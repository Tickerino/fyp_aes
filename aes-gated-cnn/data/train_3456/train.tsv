3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven�t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven�t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. �Yes, sir!	1	1		1																					
4	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn�t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  	1	1		1																					
5	3	The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first �town� he sees �One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.� If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, �In the story the speeker says �I was travling through the high deserts of California� that are very hot and dry, and he says �This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn�t have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting.	2	2		2																					
6	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1		1																					
7	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1	1		1																					
13	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� That shows he wasn�t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2		3																					
14	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2		2																					
19	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1		1																					
20	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, �a tarlike substance oozed out� of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to �short, rolling hills�, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
21	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that�s not empty or almost empty like a �ghost town� as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																					
25	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
26	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men�s help, and doesn�t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next �town� he hits doesn�t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn�t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3	3		3																					
28	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it�s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks �dehydration� and �death.� If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																					
30	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don�t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2	3		3																					
32	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1		1																					
33	3	In the essay the mshan writes of rough rodes timit the cyclist�s had to overcome to reach @CAPS1 gole.	1	1		1																					
35	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. �I could drop from a heatstroke� this shows that it was hot out and he was feeling bad if he could have dropped from a heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
37	3	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn�t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2	2		2																					
38	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren�t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men�s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2		3																					
39	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																					
40	3	The features of the settings affect in the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
41	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																					
42	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, � one long, crippling hill.� The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																					
44	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.� @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
45	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like �battery acid,� his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2		2																					
46	3	In the story of �rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit� the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he�ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1		1																					
48	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. �This sight was troubling� when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. �At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1�s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.� He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
50	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� All the road was hills and rough. Than �The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.� @CAPS1 doesn�t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																					
52	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist �traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.� He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank �water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2		3																					
53	3	The narration of �Rough Road ahead� a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states �I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June�. To disappointed the truck stop�s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2		3																					
54	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
56	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don�t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn�t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don�t go anywhere is a bad idea. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2		2																					
57	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit""  the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road:  And had to get water form a old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle"	1	1		1																					
59	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town	2	2		2																					
61	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
63	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad �when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1		2																					
64	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, �the cool pines and rushing rivers�� (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey.	2	2		2																					
66	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2		2																					
69	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it�s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1		1																					
77	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn�t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says �The sun was beginning to beat down.� This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn�t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2		2																					
80	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the �town� had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this �town� is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																					
82	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can�t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1		1																					
83	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead� which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
84	3	 The bike rider in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can�t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn�t have has either problems.	1	1		1																					
86	3	In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles.	2	2		2																					
88	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it�s to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it�s to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it�s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind�s direction.	1	1		1																					
91	3	The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2		2																					
94	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. �Not two miles into the next section.� He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																					
95	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn�t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn�t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch�s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1		2																					
98	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody�s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he�s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody�s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let�s say that he gets lost and he�ll need direction to get wherever he�s going well there�s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2		2																					
99	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn�t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
102	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist�s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it �Over on long, crippling hill�. The word �crippling� is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist�s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2		2																					
105	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1		1																					
106	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, �several rusty bumps,� is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn�t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn�t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. �Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																					
110	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. �I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
111	3	In the eassy �DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,� It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as �� of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn�t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific.	3	3		3																					
112	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
114	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I�m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1	1		1																					
117	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man�s journey he was confident in his abilities. �I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3		3																					
119	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaning how tiering it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town having to diel with lack of water poisonous snakes and the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
120	3	The setting of the essay didn�t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, �a ghost town.� @CAPS1 this couldn�t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is �traveling through the deserts of California in June.� Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																					
121	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs  that said �Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� That had to slow down his bike. �Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere	1	1		1																					
126	3	It affects the cyclist because in the begging talk�s ablut the old man. Italso talks about basically saying there information is out of aase also in other words should have just followed his map in the first place.	1	1		1																					
130	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
131	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die � I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean� then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says �I own a very good map� But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination.	2	2		2																					
134	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was �long and a               � The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1		1																					
136	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to ??? were mountains or hills winding roads and California desert in June. As well as he was running out of water.	1	1		1																					
137	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2																					
141	3	The setting in this short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned, �The sun was beginning to beat down� (@NUM1) � i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational. The cyclist at this point is not, tired and worried about the lack of water. The setting and cyclist�s state run side by side.	1	1		1																					
142	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination.	2	2		2																					
144	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and �slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� When he saw Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2		2																					
145	3	The byciclist from �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him. 	2	0		3																					
146	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of �a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																					
147	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
149	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get   the first �town�, he didn�t seem to mind. �The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he   didn�t mind or wasn�t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of �troubling sights�, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP,  his   emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful.	3	3		3																					
150	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, �the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a �ridiculously large snake� and �trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and �in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.� @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2		3																					
151	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story �@CAPS1�t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit.� It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. That�s going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
152	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now �It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.� said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1		1																					
153	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving to slow. In the story when it says �I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1,� is evidence of this	1	1		1																					
156	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. �I arrived at the first �town�. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.� He is saying that the town could�ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. �I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t cool down.� A working water pump would�ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																					
157	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be �high deserts of California in June.� That�s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the �summer time� its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	1	2		2																					
158	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
161	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead�, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles.	2	2		2																					
164	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a �ghost town� there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																					
167	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he�ll have later on. As he passes a snake, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, ��I could drop from heatstroke�� meaning he�s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he�s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he�s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																					
169	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, �wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																					
171	3	The features of the settings in �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2		2																					
173	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it�s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June��(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.	2	2		2																					
174	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...� This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
175	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2																					
176	3	The setting of the essay efects the cyclist because he got lost when he ask for directions from old people!	1	1		1																					
178	3	The feature�s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he�s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn�t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. �Rough road ahead.�  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
185	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up. and take alot of work of pedling off his hands.	1	1		1																					
188	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1		1																					
189	3	To begin with a feature that affect the cyclist was a lack of water this is shown when the speaker says when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid-thats was one of the biggest factors he had risked. 	3	2		3																					
191	3	The features of the setting in the essay �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn�t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I�d be fine�. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary� He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except �Rough Road Ahead� signs.  	2	2		2																					
192	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																					
194	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit.� The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, � a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit � sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																					
196	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn�t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																					
199	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn�t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																					
201	3	The setting of where you are riding has alot to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part.	2	2		2																					
202	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, �denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.� This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, �denyoyed� One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3	2		3																					
204	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer�s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, �.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except �Old timers who haven�t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing� (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
205	3	The terrain in �Do not exeed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, �I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
207	3	The cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water, heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a tole on the amount of energy he had to keep going. Secont the heat also affected his trip It mad it hard for him to Keep going he thought he would die. And the birds would bick at his dead body. Last the Terrain didn�t help. The trip had many hills and that used alot of energy so I made it harder. In conclusion those are things that worked against th cyclist.	2	2		2																					
211	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That�s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don�t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn�t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don�t even think so.	1	1		1																					
213	3	Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.� Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.� Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.� @CAPS1 is when he saw �Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp � If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles.	2	2		2																					
219	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said �I could drop from heat stroke�, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn�t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
221	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. For example, the sun was beginning to beat down. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. The setting were hot and dry. It effected the cyclist very much. It was to the point of dying.	2	1		2																					
224	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.	1	1		1																					
225	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many  ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic were he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This spasked his black humor The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he  could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind. ""This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. This made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he was this live and so he felt relief Of this is, ""Then as easily as  ?  ?  ?   hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me. In this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt."	3	2		3																					
228	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don�t have a setting then this will not make sence, setting is something everyone can do. It can be anywhere or anything. The setting helps puts the whole story back together. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family. Setting is a very important part in a morvie/video.	0	0		0																					
232	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist�s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up �Ghost towns� and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says �what I believed was my last burst of energy,� �I was going to die.� The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																					
233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� 	1	1		1																					
234	3	It the short story �Rough Rode Ahead� a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a �Rough Road Ahead.�	2	2		2																					
242	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn�t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
245	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven�t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn�t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn�t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his �dehydrated state.� I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn�t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn�t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																					
247	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, �This sight is troubling,�. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2	3		3																					
248	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said �sometimes life can be so cruel.� because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back,� could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen. The setting of old men who didnt know anything and the heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else."	3	2		3																					
249	3	"The cyclists problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June� so the setting is obviously a hazard."	1	1		1																					
252	3	The rode was deserted there wasn�t a builing, car, or house in sight. He was stuck andhes in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, poisonous snakes and the heat could made him collapse.	1	1		1																					
254	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in �one ramshackle shed�and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule�� and �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																					
255	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh, the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day  .	2	2		2																					
256	3	The feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and don�t have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink	1	1		1																					
258	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a �ghost town.� He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2		2																					
260	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit.	0	0		0																					
261	3	Setting is a very important element to the story �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																					
265	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
269	3	The harsh setting in �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit �by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to �Yosemite.�	3	2		3																					
279	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he�s going and how he�s gona get there. Having no water	1	1		1																					
283	3	 In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling �through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth�(Kurmaskie).	1	1		1																					
284	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,�  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3	2		3																					
286	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1�s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the �Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, �he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless� when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now �behind� him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist�s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist�s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3		3																					
287	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a �ghost town�. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
290	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some �old wise men� which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first �town� but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old �codgens� would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old � codgers� on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3	3		3																					
292	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch�s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert. The finally made it to �Only and wilbers fish camp where he know he was safe and would survive.	2	3		3																					
294	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2		2																					
298	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn�t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. �High deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																					
301	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
302	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn�t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3	3		3																					
305	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.	1	1		1																					
308	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, �I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a �short cut� that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2	3		3																					
310	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,� affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was �traveling through the high desserts� which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, �trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.� From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into �A far like substance� The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
315	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
316	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
317	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said �I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.�	1	2		2																					
319	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																					
320	3	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot but with �cool pines and risum river� it was worth the ride. It keep him cool so he could get his weter in the nex town. That is why I think that the pin and river were a big help.	1	1		1																					
323	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn�t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn�t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.	3	3		3																					
327	3	The setting it the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3	2		3																					
329	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
330	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says �wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.� The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign �Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																					
331	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it�s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He�s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he�s indespair at the time. When he says �It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he�s not in a good shape and he knows he�s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																					
333	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn�t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This means it was hot and couldn�t find water."	2	2		2																					
334	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																					
337	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
339	3	There are many ways in which the setting of �Rough Road ahead� affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the �rough road� affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. 	2	1		2																					
341	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn�t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  	1	1		1																					
345	3	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn�t in �High deserts of California in June� he probaly wouldn�t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn�t be so hot out. Also if there weren�t �short rolling hills� he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.	1	1		1																					
346	3	There were many features that affect the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down. Also the hills and sun were a big problem.	1	1		1																					
349	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit�(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																					
350	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him.	2	2		2																					
353	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to � short, rolling hills,� which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3	3		3																					
355	3	The cyclist in the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																					
356	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope . When he came across a sign which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 per hour. Because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. If he would have been bitten he would have died. Finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatsroke ""wide signs  of   dried""       "	2	2		2																					
358	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, � I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																					
361	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.	2	2		2																					
362	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist�s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men�s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he�d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     "	3	2		3																					
363	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Their are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength� That is telling us he�s working too hard, than he�ll be worn out to ride. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
365	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn�t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1� degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2� degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in �No @CAPS2�s @CAPS3�. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1		1																					
367	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says �have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office� gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
369	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he�s doing in weather that he could, �drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he�s seeing a mirage of a �building-abandoned years ealier.� The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2	3		3																					
370	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through.	1	1		1																					
373	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,� there was a �long crippling hill� all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2	3		3																					
374	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says �I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says�� in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there�s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn�t have a good map.	2	2		2																					
375	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn�t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn�t it?! 	2	3		3																					
384	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it�s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That�s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  	1	1		1																					
386	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can�t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he�ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that�s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
390	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.	1	1		1																					
392	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it could be a good or bad thing. If a cyclist adjust his own settings thats good but if somebody messe with them that could be bad.	0	0		0																					
393	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3		3																					
395	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay �I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
399	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first �town� he is not too worried about it and moves on. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.� @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked �and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn�t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author�s moods.	3	3		3																					
402	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
403	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
405	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, �short, rolling hills�, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn�t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																					
406	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
407	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn�t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist �as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2		2																					
409	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story �who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch�s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3	3		3																					
411	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. �One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me.� This could also cause a problem because he can�t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can�t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.	2	2		2																					
413	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the �town.� The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
415	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn�t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1		1																					
418	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the �old timers� he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3		3																					
420	3	"In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He�s also running low on water,�The water bottles only contained & few tantalizing sips.� He�s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He�s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future."	2	2		2																					
422	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says �their were no cars nor buildings in sight� that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an �oldtimer� asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2		2																					
423	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it�s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.	2	2		2																					
424	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first �town�, he could tell there�d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2		2																					
425	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0		0																					
427	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3																					
429	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2		2																					
430	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he �had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. �@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, �somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, �ghost town� infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; �there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn�t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3	3		3																					
434	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can�t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																					
435	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
439	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit� the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, �At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.� This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of �old-timers.� From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, �About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first �town�, a ghost town,� �The sun was beginning to heat down,� This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a �A Rough Road Ahead� sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																					
442	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1		1																					
445	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop. A prime example to how he started leds and a smile on my face �to� and the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June becaused listen to some gentelmen who hadn�t been off their perch in decades � to� I had an over welming urse to seek out Gary and wilber kiss them and buy some bait. � The over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels.	2	3		3																					
449	3	"In the start story �Do not exceed speed limit,� time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist�s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1		1																					
452	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist does in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by.	1	1		1																					
453	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.	1	1		1																					
456	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us ��I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.� The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  �towns� were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																					
457	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said � I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength� that shows desperation due to the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
463	3	"In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, �one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he�s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it�s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it�s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3	2		3																					
464	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1		1																					
469	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN�T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH�S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE �HUNG HIS HEAD.� HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN�T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.	2	2		2																					
473	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1		1																					
474	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don�t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																					
475	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
476	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2		2																					
478	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
482	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																					
487	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2		2																					
489	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says �the bulding abandoned years earlier.� If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
490	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist�s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� The author wouldn�t have been so dehydrated if it weren�t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn�t have been any conflicts.	2	2		2																					
493	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it�s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.	1	1		1																					
496	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn�t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. �The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.� (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																					
499	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren�t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. There were rusted water pump�s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
502	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.� and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don�t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
503	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1		1																					
504	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1		1																					
506	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with �His name written over them�. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. �That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																					
510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn�t have much water. In the text it says �I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.� The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn�t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1		1																					
516	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2	3		3																					
520	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn�t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2		2																					
521	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1		1																					
523	3	The setting of the place was �ghost town� as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn�t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																					
525	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said �Drop from heatstroke.� this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																					
526	3	The features of the setting affected the author�s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says �over one long, crippling hill.� This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn�t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1		1																					
531	3	"The cyclist is effected by the setting in �Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , �over a long crippling hill,� the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."	1	1		1																					
532	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
533	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist�s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker�s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
535	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).� This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his �shortcut� his running out of water. That�s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2		2																					
537	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																					
539	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
540	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn�t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
545	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in �the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2		2																					
546	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn�t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2		2																					
551	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.	2	2		2																					
554	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states �The sun was beginning to beat down,� @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says �@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states �dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
555	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.� I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he �toiled� on, the terrain features became even more trying,� over one long, crippling hill��By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																					
558	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. If you arn�t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. �With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2		2																					
559	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1		1																					
561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1		1																					
567	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  �Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
568	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author tells a story about when he took advice from �old folks� and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example �tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake�� and a �crippling hill� these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1		1																					
571	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist�s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 	1	1		1																					
573	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
576	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat �beginning to beat down� on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he �could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills�, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2		3																					
577	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn�t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1		1																					
578	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasn�t there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.	1	1		1																					
579	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 	1	1		1																					
581	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
584	3	In �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    	1	1		1																					
590	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn�t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																					
591	3	In the cyclist�s outlook on his journey through Yosemite�s park, reader�s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																					
593	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. �I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																					
594	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch�s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn�t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch�s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																					
596	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																					
599	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are pretty dangerous. �a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn�t an expert on snakes because he couldn�t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2		3																					
601	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn�t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2		2																					
603	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
604	3	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, @CAPS1 said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.� @CAPS1 had high doubt when saying that quote. @CAPS1 didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it. Finally, @CAPS1 reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!	2	2		2																					
605	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into �short, rolling hills,� These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The horizon was what kept cyclist going. �I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																					
606	3	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don�t understand much, so I can�t write much.	0	0		0																					
608	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn�t come out. ��working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out�.� (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.	1	1		1																					
609	3	The feautures of the settings affect the cyclist if it is just between buildings and cars the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. So it can affect him.	0	0		0																					
611	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																					
612	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. �a ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don�t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																					
613	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. �A rediculously large snake� this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.� I could drop from heat stroke� another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.� There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.� The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.� This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
614	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.	2	2		2																					
615	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
616	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated �when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.	1	1		1																					
617	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp,� he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																					
618	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1�s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, �with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        	3	3		3																					
621	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 	2	3		3																					
623	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
624	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn�t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																					
626	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.	1	1		1																					
627	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn�t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. 	2	1		2																					
628	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see�s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
629	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.	1	2		2																					
631	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he get tiring. The character, in the story is ridding his bike for a long period of time and he gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or none around his accept the tries and wild animals.	1	1		1																					
632	3	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
633	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is the cyclist have a rough hill with wish.	1	1		1																					
634	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
635	3	Knew what he was getting himself into so if he needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt he should have brought some with him.	1	1		1																					
636	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The �deserts of California in June� caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																					
637	3	The story is basically talking about more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school�s so it want be alot of polution in the air.	0	0		0																					
640	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																					
641	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1		1																					
642	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I�ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate� he wouldn�t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn�t thirsty."	1	1		1																					
647	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn�t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
648	3	The rider in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider �rode into the morning...with a smile� because of the bright sun, and the �cool pines� and rushing rivers�...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the �ramshackle shed...� And the �...sight of this was troubling...� to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the �crippling hills� that maybe this wasn�t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the �modern bathroom� that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																					
649	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat & little water. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination.	1	1		1																					
650	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn�t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods.	1	1		1																					
651	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It�s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  "	1	1		1																					
653	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn�t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn�t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn�t trust old men anymore. They didn�t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																					
655	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																					
656	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
658	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he�s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a �ghost town� where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn�t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It�s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn�t find water yet. It doesn�t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen�t find water.	2	3		3																					
660	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on �nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope�. It all depends on where you are cycling. �It didn�t really matter I was going to die.� This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2																					
662	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind. But also good exercising especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you going could take forever. But I do know what they would have to face all types of weather, but as long as you have gear on no harm could come to you.	1	1		1																					
663	3	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn�t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn�t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.  	1	1		1																					
669	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn�t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he�s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the �sight was troubling� which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have.	2	2		2																					
670	3	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 play an affect are the heat, flat road that�s had to ride on, or how there	1	1		1																					
671	3	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.	1	1		1																					
674	3	"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, �I hung my head.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
675	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,� the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say �@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he�d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																					
677	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed.	0	0		0																					
684	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn�t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn�t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																					
685	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says �Tumbleweeds cross my path� this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
686	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That�s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.�   	2	1		2																					
690	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically.	3	0		3																					
693	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� , and this is making him really thirsty. �[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly �because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn�t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber�s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways.	2	3		3																					
697	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, �This sight was troubling,� he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																					
698	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, �A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn�t cool down,� it showed how he wasn�t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn�t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3	3		3																					
699	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? � It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� The heat must have been bad, he wasn�t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men �helping� with directions.	2	2		2																					
702	3	The cyclit of �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was �@NUM1 degers�. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would�ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																					
703	3	"The lone biker in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.�The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,� in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																					
704	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn�t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn�t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																					
706	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn�t have any more water also, there aren�t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																					
708	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn�t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2	2		2																					
711	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.	3	2		3																					
714	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who�s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "	2	2		2																					
716	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
717	3	"It can�t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience �it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, �This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.�This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. �at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3																					
718	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																					
719	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.	2	2		2																					
720	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the �old timers"" directions. From this quote; �a ton-like substance oozed out.� This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, �I hung my head� this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																					
721	3	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn�t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.	2	2		2																					
722	3	During the cyclist�s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn�t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																					
723	3	The setting effects the rider because if it�s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
724	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. 	1	1		1																					
725	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from �Flat read�, (Kurmaskie) to �short, rolling hills� (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�	2	2		2																					
726	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
728	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along �The high deserts of California in June�, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small �gost towns� rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as �Short rolling hills� through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																					
732	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn�t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
733	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																					
734	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1		2																					
735	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as �the sun was beating down� and �high deserts of California in June� to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says �short rolling hills�, �tumbleweeds� and �long, crippling hill� to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a �rediculously large snake� and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																					
736	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates	2	2		2																					
738	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, � I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."	2	2		2																					
740	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
743	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn�t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.	1	1		1																					
744	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town. After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it. So never take advice from old timers.   	1	1		1																					
747	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like �battery acid.� Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
751	3	When the cyclist is in the �serenity of an early sunset evening�, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
753	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story �do not exceed posted speed limit� It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.� this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																					
754	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
755	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happing years ago are happen now in todays world meaning wars. Rights & etc todays feature is the same. Every thing is repeating it�s self.	0	0		0																					
757	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The �towns� he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn�t get more water or a place to rest. �I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel�. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
760	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. �When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1		1																					
763	3	In  the   cyclist   story  the  setting   took  a  huge  roll on  how  the  story    thined   out.The  water  had  a lot  of  effects  on  the  cyclist.The  setting  of the story  took  place  in  the  high  deserts of  california   in  june.As  soon  as  you  read   that  you  now  something  is  wrong.In   the  story  he say  ,the  sun  was  beginning    to  beat  down .This  is going  to  affect  him because  hes  riding  through the desert on  a  bike,which  causes  him  to  become  dehydrated .I  eased  past,trying  to  keep my  balance  in  my dehydrated  state.Thes begining   to  lose  his  mind  because  he  has  no water  because   of  the  setting.Everything  about  the setting  causes  the  cyclist  some  problems.The  heat ,the   setting ,the  lack  of  water  almost  causes him his  life.    	2	1		2																					
765	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, ��  gaining elevation while loosing hope.� Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
769	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he�s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old �codgers�  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.� Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3	2		3																					
770	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
774	3	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot. It was very hard for him to go any fourther but he knew he had to keep going. Also the land was very barin and ething around. Clearlier the setting effected the biker.	1	1		1																					
775	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn�t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
777	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. �� I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
778	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said �Rough Road Ahead� he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate�. Lastly, �GARY AND WILBER�S FISH CAMP�, could possibly have saved the cyclist�s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  	2	2		2																					
780	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don�t ride as much anymore and don�t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																					
782	3	From what there is in this  picture the cyclist is riding a dry and area which could mean that it is very hab and the cyclsit looks to be going down hill there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a bag stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired the wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all.	1	1		1																					
783	3	In the short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first �town� the locals said he�d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has �the flavor of battery acid.� With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June�, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a �water-depleting @NUM3.� eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																					
784	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn�t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2																					
788	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man�s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
789	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.	1	1		1																					
790	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes. For example, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.� This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�  	1	1		1																					
791	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																					
793	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water �all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, �I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.� This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition�s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.	1	1		1																					
795	3	The setting of where the cyclist was, was a californa desert in the middle of June. He thinks hes going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sinse carter was in office.� This means to never take directions from people who haven�t been to the place for  a while.	1	1		1																					
797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in �ghost towns�, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like �battery acid� and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.	1	1		1																					
802	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. �But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. �After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he�s relieved.	2	2		2																					
808	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																					
810	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he�s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he�s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He�s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																					
812	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirge.� shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says �and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
813	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of �oh my gosh, its really hot,� type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn�t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																					
814	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1																					
815	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2	3		3																					
817	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn�t cool down.	1	1		1																					
820	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou	3	2		3																					
822	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																					
824	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� �a large highway sign jumped out atm.� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.� �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.	2	1		2																					
825	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in �do not exceed posted speed limit.� As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author�s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of �do not exceed posted speed limit� places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.	3	3		3																					
833	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, �it didn�t matter it was going to die, �this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn�t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   	1	1		1																					
834	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, �Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.� He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn�t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn�t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																					
835	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																					
838	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�, I don�t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
839	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																					
840	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink	1	1		1																					
842	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it�s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
843	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he�s fine. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them� (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn�t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, �It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� he knows that things are going to get rough, because �the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph�. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn�t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, �tumble weeds crossed my path.� The landscape seems to get more threatening too, �a ridiculously large shake.� The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																					
844	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and no humanity makes him so crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2. It would be just the heat because there are people every were in @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2. If he was in @LOCATION1 it would be the severe temperature drop and no humanity and he would probably die.	1	1		1																					
847	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as �water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.	2	2		2																					
848	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum.	2	1		2																					
854	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can�t get water is a major issue.	1	1		1																					
856	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads.	1	1		1																					
860	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn�t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																					
861	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men."	2	1		2																					
862	3	The features of the setting include �There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.	1	1		1																					
866	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it taliks about how the man is pedling twenty miles here and fourty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water abd he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because its do not that he need more water. As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. "" I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine."" This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persitance. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay."	3	2		3																					
868	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1� outside and sunny. You can�t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can�t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																					
869	3	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote �about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first �town�. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time�. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2		2																					
871	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn�t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																					
873	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a �short cut�, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This �short cut� prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men�s �short cut� made this cyclist�s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3	2		3																					
877	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water. Another factor is the limited supply of water. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren�t always wrong but their info. Can be out of date.	1	1		1																					
878	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be �There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is �wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden�t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
879	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn�t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like �Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2	3		3																					
881	3	"The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2																					
883	3	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.	1	2		2																					
886	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1		2																					
887	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the �high deserts of California�, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must�ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must�ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it�s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																					
889	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a �ghost town� Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, ��water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist��	2	2		2																					
892	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn�t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider�s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																					
894	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn�t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.	2	2		2																					
895	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																					
896	3	When cycling it�s important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, make sure of the weather, make sure of the environment, and most importantly make sure of your resources. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have and enjoyable and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip.  	1	1		1																					
897	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by travelling very far where he is going. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probaly someone that had not ever been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him."	2	2		2																					
898	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed� by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says �One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn�t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider.	2	2		2																					
899	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn�t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																					
904	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.	1	1		1																					
906	3	That the cyclist is steyetling down up totally end steep within when to get to his destination of the town settle out are taken mean yesterday. The condition in hand and hurry some when and have one his body.  	1	1		1																					
909	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,� That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.� This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
912	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town� he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong."	1	1		1																					
913	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.� That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty	1	1		1																					
914	3	The conditions of the enviroment as well as the road can majory effect the cyclist. For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand if it is hot and rough paths and hilly roads the biker colud dehidrate and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Those five the conditions of the enviroment effect a cyclist greatly.	2	1		2																					
916	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story �Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
920	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
921	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says �and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June�. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says �I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul�. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2	2		2																					
922	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he�s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.� This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 	2	1		2																					
924	3	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with �short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.	2	2		2																					
926	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
927	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren�t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn�t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																					
928	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a �substance� it had a flavor of battery acid. �If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2	2		2																					
930	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ��The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																					
931	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
932	3	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	1	2		2																					
936	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. � Sometimes life can be so cruel� implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																					
938	3	In the story �Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is faced with many problems. It�s really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn�t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with.	1	1		1																					
941	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, �slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.�  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The �heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.� I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. �Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3	3		3																					
943	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn�t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn�t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn�t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
946	3	�Do not Exceed the posted speed limit� tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of �the serenity of an early summer evening,� and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the �town� he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist�s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																					
949	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit� affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.� The road change and the heat made him say �I could drop from heatstroke.� Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																					
950	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the �old codgers,� the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,� as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn�t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when �a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement�� He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																					
951	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit� had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist�s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																					
954	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of no where with barley any water left and on top of all that he�s exhausted from all the hills on the terrien. So because he took a shortcut it ending up costing him in the long run.	1	1		1																					
956	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, �I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.� In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water.	1	2		2																					
958	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.	2	2		2																					
959	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																					
961	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn�t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
962	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don�t come out and say it, but they do say, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� We all know that it your out side when it�s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
963	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
964	3	In the story �Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, �the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern�t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2	3		3																					
965	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn�t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a �ghost town�, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   	2	2		2																					
969	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a �run-down� rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																					
971	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.	0	0		0																					
975	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.	2	2		2																					
976	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
977	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the �sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2	3		3																					
978	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it�s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It�s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn�t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																					
980	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, �I could drop from heatstroke�. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, �l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. This has a big affect on him, because he�s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																					
981	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.� I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn�t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit�, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
982	3	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.	1	1		1																					
983	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.	1	2		2																					
985	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted�. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill�. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile�	3	2		3																					
988	3	The author�s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist�s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he�s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person�s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																					
991	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
994	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first �town�, and described it as only having �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall� I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn�t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp � If you want bait for the big ones, we�ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
995	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
996	3	The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude.	1	1		1																					
997	3	The settings in this article effect the cyclist by having to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has limited amount of water and its very hot out. Theres nothing insight for miles and miles.	1	1		1																					
999	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And was unable to have a supporter to help	2	3		3																					
1000	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, �They�d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																					
1005	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																					
1006	3	The setting in the short story; �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, �Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can�t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1008	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don�t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																					
1009	3	"In the essay, �Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling�, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a �modernized� town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
1010	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																					
1014	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated �I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1�. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages �A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1																					
1017	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist�s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																					
1020	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A �ghost town� with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																					
1021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the �ghost town� he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 	2	2		2																					
1023	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first �town� he found he described as a �ghost town� It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn�t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey �a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? �which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways	3	2		3																					
1025	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
1026	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1027	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 he makes note that he�s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he�d be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2		2																					
1028	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were �I was going to die.� First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1		1																					
1029	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He�s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It�s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he�s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1		1																					
1030	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the �high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist also saw a �ridiculously large snake.� There was also no signs of civilization for miles.� There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
1031	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can�t mother nature control you.	1	1		1																					
1032	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
1035	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2		2																					
1036	3	"The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it�s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he�s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
1037	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good �it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1�. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I�m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said �the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2		2																					
1038	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes �that road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels �life can feel so cruel� (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1039	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																					
1043	3	In the poem �Do not exceed speed limit� the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake� This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
1045	3	The setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits� affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on �there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.� At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2		2																					
1048	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he�s going to die. He shows that he�s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2		3																					
1049	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles �battery acid.� The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, �sometimes life can feel so cruel,� which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2		2																					
1052	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said� I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine,� By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2		2																					
1055	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That�s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2		2																					
1056	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn�t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach �rough roads� creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait �tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3		3																					
1059	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																					
1060	3	The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit� affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as �a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.� The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, �The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large� snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn�t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																					
1061	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker�s determination did too, �Flat road were replaced by short hills�. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. �I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades�. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�,. But the bumpy terrain didn�t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1066	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert	1	1		1																					
1068	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1		1																					
1069	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. 	2	1		2																					
1070	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for �rough road ahead,� @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																					
1071	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they�re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
1072	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1074	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn�t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn�t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn�t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn�t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn�t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don�t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																					
1075	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1		1																					
1076	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,�water-deplating� one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as �rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator�s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
1077	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																					
1079	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in �high desert of California in June.� This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1080	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn�t get any water. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,� he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, �The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,� it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.	1	1		1																					
1082	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																					
1083	3	The setting desented in the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer�s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																					
1086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say �old timers who haven�t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office� that what he is explaining. He then say �I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did �He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn�t mirage and tried not get to excited� @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																					
1087	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says �haven�t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.� I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																					
1088	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																					
1089	3	The features in the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like �battery acid�. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.	2	2		2																					
1096	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it�s too hot, you�re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it�s all down hill, it�s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1		2																					
1097	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,	2	2		2																					
1098	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through �high deserts in @LOCATION1� where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.	1	1		1																					
1101	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike.	2	1		2																					
1103	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that �don�t remember the saying don�t take candy from strangers.� So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it�s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that �the old man hasn�t been off his porch since Carter was in office,� so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude.	1	1		1																					
1104	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn�t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn�t think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That�s how the setting affected the character.	1	1		1																					
1105	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the �shortcut� there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn�t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3		3																					
1107	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn�t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2		3																					
1110	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don�t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1		1																					
1111	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.	1	1		1																					
1112	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can�t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June� The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1		1																					
1114	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example �One long, crippling hill� I can picture it in my head. �There was no one in sight.� All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1		1																					
1115	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the �rolling hills� @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go.	2	2		2																					
1118	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2		2																					
1122	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.	1	1		1																					
1123	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn�t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would�ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don�t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2		2																					
1124	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he�s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he�s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� when he sees that he panics and thinks he�s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1		1																					
1126	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road.� The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. � This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were �crippling"". The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn�t know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one."	2	1		2																					
1127	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes �ghost towns,� �abandoned buildings,� and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of �dropping� dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing �what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he�ll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3		3																					
1128	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had �wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,� and he could �drop from heatstroke.� The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn�t have been as affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1134	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states� The sun was beginning to beat down� (@CAPS1).	1	1		1																					
1135	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1140	3	The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war � but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, �this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted. The next example of how the features and the settings	2	3		3																					
1142	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2		2																					
1143	3	The setting is in a California which isn�t really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]	1	1		1																					
1144	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, �I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.� At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. �this sight was trowoling�. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1146	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.� So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn�t help him much.  	3	2		3																					
1148	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.	1	2		2																					
1150	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.	3	3		3																					
1160	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it. He took advice from old people to do it. But even though it started out good almost nothing last forever. Hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 	2	2		2																					
1162	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn�t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1164	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. �I could make that� he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, �I was sad�. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2	3		3																					
1167	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water �to feel sorry for himself� The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to �rolling hills�. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																					
1169	3	In the short story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.� The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, �And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people�s sense of directions.	3	3		3																					
1170	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1		1																					
1171	3	The setting in the story was the �high deserts of California in June.� At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn�t make it he saw a sign that said �Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp� He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� and �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3		3																					
1172	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don�t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1		1																					
1175	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden�t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn�t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																					
1177	3	The setting of the cyclist�s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn�t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2		2																					
1178	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The rider didn�t think he would live �I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean� but he found a place to get water �drank deeply from the sink� and finished his ride."	2	2		2																					
1179	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn�t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																					
1180	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can�t and they shouldn�t do this or that such as the sign of �no entering� or �one way�. Second, it�s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn�t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of �Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit�. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1		1																					
1181	3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.	3	2		3																					
1182	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch�s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1185	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2		3																					
1187	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly �(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn�t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3		3																					
1189	3	"The features of the setting, in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth�. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
1190	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story �As worry� because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.	1	1		1																					
1194	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert�s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2		3																					
1195	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story �@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into� a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road	2	2		2																					
1197	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don�t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer.	3	0		2																					
1200	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1		1																					
1202	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, �battery acid,� that he wouldn�t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1		1																					
1203	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a �ramshackle shed� surrounded by �several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lames mule�, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can�t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says �sometimes life can be so cruel� as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn�t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation �should please all sadists� reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3	3		3																					
1206	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ��but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�� This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2		2																					
1209	3	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.	1	1		1																					
1211	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their �short-cut.� It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from �old-timers that hadn�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1		1																					
1212	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0		0																					
1213	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks � are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example �Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1		1																					
1214	3	What l believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, �The old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be bot as they say in the book the world iso fluid place things change all the time. So for the cyclist to find his way he had to try and put together the the piece the old guys gave him.	1	1		1																					
1215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn�t put the sitting in rain or he wouldn't be ride the bike. Anther one is you wouldn�t have a the sitting a city when there is nothing around but trees and rivers.	1	1		1																					
1216	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.	2	2		2																					
1219	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1		1																					
1220	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist�s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2		2																					
1221	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1		1																					
1223	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral	1	1		1																					
1226	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 that California is called, �the sunshine state�, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1227	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1		1																					
1228	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.	1	1		1																					
1229	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the �short cut� that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2		3																					
1231	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn�t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn�t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn�t see anything in sight.	3	3		3																					
1233	3	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood.	1	1		1																					
1234	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don�t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2		2																					
1235	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� He thought he knew where he was going �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, �this sight was troubling�. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, �she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was �only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. � The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, �Gary and wilbers fish camp�. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2		2																					
1237	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3	3		3																					
1238	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist�s journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.	3	3		3																					
1243	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were	1	1		1																					
1245	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn�t left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)	1	1		1																					
1249	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn�t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn�t been running out of water I don�t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3	2		3																					
1251	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.� This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.� This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, �To @CAPS2 a fire� where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3																					
1255	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says �the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and then it goes on to say, �I could drop from from a heat stroke.� This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1		2																					
1262	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.� This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn�t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, �the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to.	2	2		2																					
1263	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this �journey� to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. �A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.� This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says �working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.� @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1266	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without brake, and the hot temperatures. �When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesn�t find water soon, it will affect herb condition. Also, the features of the setting affects her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town. she works harder. ""i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit""(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town, as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher."	3	2		3																					
1267	3	"During the cyclist journey in �Rough Road Ahead� by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. �Flat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.� Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.� this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That�s how the land changes  "	1	1		1																					
1269	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like �diamond head snakes� cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 	2	2		2																					
1271	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste �like battery acid.� And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself	1	1		1																					
1272	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1	1		1

1274	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that it�s affected by a variety of things, and problems. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when"	2	2		2																					
1275	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This setting is a major setback to the cyclist�s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3		3																					
1276	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy. The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.	1	1		1																					
1278	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can�t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier.	1	1		1																					
1283	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1		1																					
1287	3	In the passage �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, �I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1		1																					
1288	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn�t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2		2																					
1290	3	In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men�s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn�t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3	2		3																					
1292	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump�s water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.	1	2		2																					
1294	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich �was to slice away hours� from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a �baren ghost town� the next had water �the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don�t let old timers try and change your mind.	3	2		3																					
1295	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn�t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated.  and could have even died. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
1298	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.	1	1		1																					
1299	3	In the story,� Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, �Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills �@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure� tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.� The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3		3																					
1300	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.�(Kurmaskie�s) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.	1	2		2																					
1301	3	In the book �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey	1	1		1																					
1302	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1		1																					
1305	3	In the short story � Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit.� A lot of things affeced cyclist. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says �when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.� this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didn�t help.	1	1		1																					
1308	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had �a smile on.� (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn�t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1309	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.	1	1		1																					
1310	3	"The setting in �Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake �a ridiculously large"" snake � it realy didn�t look like a diamondback � blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me �(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
1311	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "	2	2		2																					
1316	3	In the short story �Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1317	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. �The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.� By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn�t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was �water depleting @NUM2.�	2	1		2																					
1319	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, �ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,� this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."	2	2		2																					
1322	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, � The  sun was beginning to beat down , � (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired �because � it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June �. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2		2																					
1324	3	The scenery makes the cyclist hapy. He�s sooooooooooooo happsy! Woohoo! happsy	0	0		0																					
1326	3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 �Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit.� The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by �a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men�s directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.� This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn�t even reach that limit. However, he�s determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.	3	2		3																					
1327	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2		2																					
1330	3	In the short story, �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1		1																					
1333	3	Heat, dessert, humidity � all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, �� water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.� This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.	2	2		2																					
1334	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers �shortcut� as he states that �things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� But what he didn�t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first �town� which was a ghost town. He wasn�t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how �a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3		3																					
1335	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn�t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1�. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn�t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber�s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who �haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
1337	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can�t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1340	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1341	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because	1	1		1																					
1342	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn�t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   	1	1		1																					
1350	3	When you do something really to often you get used to it, well I think is the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a diferent shape and with different shep I dont mean that they are diformed but evey person is diferen so their back can either have a �@CAPS1� shape or an �I� shape or a �D� shape.	0	0		0																					
1351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		3																					
1353	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he�s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1		1																					
1355	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist�s condition. For example, the author wrote �Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye� The way the author described the hill as �crippling� should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist�s journey was, �that smoky blues tune ''Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.� This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist�s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader�s perception of the cyclist�s journey.   	3	2		3																					
1358	3	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, �At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.� This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.	2	2		2																					
1361	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.	1	1		1																					
1363	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.� When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.� @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people � crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead.�	3	3		3																					
1364	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.	1	1		1																					
1365	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1		1																					
1366	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he he went to had either bad as or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was make him feel funny, he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages.	1	1		1																					
1368	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, �there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind.� As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1369	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.	1	1		1																					
1370	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says �Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 example is �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.� These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1375	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldn�t stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him.	1	2		2																					
1381	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     "	1	2		2																					
1386	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says �neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.� He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1		1																					
1390	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The getting of the story is, �a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California� during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3	3		3																					
1391	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old�s men�s short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would 	3	3		3																					
1392	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3		3																					
1394	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn�t even notice how hot it is and he says, �the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like �battery acid.� As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.	2	2		2																					
1395	3	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn�t have good water, �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, �in my dehydrated state� (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.	2	2		2																					
1397	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him.Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit.	2	1		2																					
1398	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.	1	2		2																					
1399	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off � road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story �Do Exceed posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, �I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2		2																					
1401	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber� This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
1402	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw �short, rolling hills,� tumbleweeds� and �a ridiculously large shake,� and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1		1																					
1404	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.	1	1		1																					
1408	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,� the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says �The sun was beginning to beat down. �This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is �I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees �this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn�t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist qoutes.�At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.	3	3		3																					
1411	3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself �the next town was only eighteen miles.� After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would �take your mind off of thirst.� When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride	3	2		3																					
1412	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2	2		2																					
1413	3	The setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit� affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1		1																					
1414	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he�s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn�t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn�t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.	1	1		1																					
1416	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. �@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.	2	1		2																					
1417	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn�t refill hi water.	1	1		1																					
1419	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1		1																					
1421	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence �It didn�t really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down� The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.	1	2		2																					
1422	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, �a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist doesn�t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, �the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant�. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1423	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2		2																					
1426	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. �The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I�m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.� That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. �With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author�s �Short, rolling hills�, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I�m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3		3																					
1429	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
1431	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn�t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2		2																					
1435	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says �The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.� This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2	2		2																					
1438	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader.

1445	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced.	1	1		1																					
1448	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.�� @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the� pavement in front of me.� He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that �really did look like a diamondback.� @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it�s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.� I�d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning.

1450	3	The author was affected in many ways be the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn�t have much water, and got lost. Water simple was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like thing would get worser and worser for him. A man had gave him the wrong directions and he probably hadn�t been off his porch in decades the author saids.	2	2		2																					
1453	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way.	1	1		1																					
1454	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.	3	3		3																					
1455	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn�t drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.	2	2		2																					
1456	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the �high deserts of California in June.� That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first �town� he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it�s hot, and he�s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2	2		2																					
1457	3	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.	1	1		1																					
1458	3	In the �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.	2	2		2																					
1460	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1		1

Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That�s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1		1																					
1462	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2	3		3																					
1463	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn�t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found �several rusty pumps,� and �one ramshackle shed.� This probably didnt help him because he didn�t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn�t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that �There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind� and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn�t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story �Rough road ahead� the setting in the story didn�t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn�t help that he was in a desert.	3	3		3																					
1464	3	"Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mother he is probably not going to be happy. The ""ghost towns"" aren't really a boost of confidence either. The rugged hills made him angry too. The heat affected him the most."	1	1		1																					
1467	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he �enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.� The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the �collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he �promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2	3		3																					
1469	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.	1	1		1																					
1470	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there�s a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic.	2	2		2																					
1471	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE �SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,� AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN �GHOST TOWNS� THAT CONSISTS OF �RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS� AND �SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.� THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN�T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS �TUMBLEWEEDS� AND �PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES� ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE �@NUM1 ROAD� ONLY DOING �12 MPH.� ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A �LONG CROPPING HILL,� THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3	2		3																					
1472	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won�t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be �Never accept to	1	1		1																					
1473	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. �Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn�t taken the �shortcut� that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3		3																					
1474	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch�s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, �with all my strength.� @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because �it had the flavor of battery acid.� Next, the Welch�s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of �a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice�, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2�s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.� He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3		3																					
1475	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right	0	0		0																					
1476	3	In the setting they are in lodi, California. That is a part of the desert. The desert effects the cyclist real bad. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can�t get anymore water, so the setting does effect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1480	3	The features of his journey are cruel. �Rolling hills,� make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don�t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1		2																					
1483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.	2	2		2																					
1484	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 	1	1		1																					
1485	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2		3																					
1488	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California� The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, �tumbleweeds crossed in path.� The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought & dying and being picked apart by birds."	2	2		2																					
1490	3	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.	2	2		2																					
1491	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3		3																					
1495	3	In the story �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,� The setting is a long road with �no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1		1																					
1496	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he �enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening�. The word �serenity� gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the �ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule� in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating �Rough Road Ahead�. Kurmaskie�s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a �rather modern bathroom� where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie�s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3		3																					
1498	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he�s perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule� It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of �Gary wilber�s fish camp,� and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.	3	3		3																					
1499	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1		1																					
1500	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The heat could have killed him anytime. For example �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2	2		2																					
1507	3	I work better when I can feel the  environment.  I think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.	1	1		1																					
1513	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it�s going to be very hot and he�ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch�s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn�t help his dehydration. That�s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you�re riding a bike during the summer	2	2		2																					
1520	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, �Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view�. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. Also it says in the story �I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
1521	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3	2		3																					
1522	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the �old timers� were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says� The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.� He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth� just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon � Gary and wilber�s fish camp best bet� then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3	3		3																					
1523	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3	2		3																					
1525	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about �two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.� If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.	1	1		1																					
1526	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1527	3	"There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill.� He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 � l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
1528	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says ��and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke�� (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrarator also says, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.	2	1		2																					
1529	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That�s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1531	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2		3																					
1532	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn�t have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn�t be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn�t be found and wouldn�t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride."	3	2		3																					
1533	3	The cyclist �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you�re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said �In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant.� He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying �I�m going to die.� - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
1534	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, �In the high deserts of California in June.� It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they�d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could�ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would�ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn�t go through.	2	3		3																					
1535	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.	1	1		1																					
1538	3	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.	1	1		1																					
1541	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist�s moods in many ways. The story says. �About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town.� ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2		2																					
1542	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong	1	2		2																					
1543	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that �helped� him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       	2	2		2																					
1546	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don�t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2	3		3																					
1547	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1		1																					
1548	3	From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercising while making on  ???. It�s hard to see  ??????????? thing. My attitude will go farm.� I�m so determined to I�m bored � to� what�s the point.� But I thought it was great how he never gave up ??? things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals.        	2	2		2																					
1549	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1		1																					
1551	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing� (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.	1	2		2																					
1555	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water	1	1		1																					
1556	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.� He was very doubtful he�d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2		2																					
1557	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2�. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2		3																					
1558	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn�t so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn�t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved.	2	1		2																					
1560	3	The features of the setting of �Do not exceed posted speed limit� greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.	3	2		3																					
1561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water �a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel�. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the �battery acid� tasting water. Also there was the Welch�s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. �A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head�. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1563	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3		3																					
1564	3	The desert is the crulest of nature�s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert�s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.� If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. �As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, �the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear�.	3	2		3																					
1567	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1		1																					
1569	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, � on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.� This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. � growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke � This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.	2	1		2																					
1575	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.	1	1		1																					
1576	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1		2																					
1577	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon�t talk to strangers. The main character	1	1		1																					
1578	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don�t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person�s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don�t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn�t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.	2	1		2																					
1579	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3		3																					
1581	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through �The high deserts of California in June.� It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could �drop from heatstroke� at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the �crippling� hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind� The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3		3																					
1585	3	Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert,� considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn�t have taken directions in the first place.	2	2		2																					
1586	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit� effects the cyclist in many was. The words �high deserts of California in June,� from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don�t have water you don�t have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead.� There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.	2	2		2																					
1590	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features seriously impared his bike ride.	2	2		2																					
1591	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he�d jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.	1	1		1																					
1592	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� greatly affect the cyclist. I�m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in �the california desert in the middle of June� does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I�m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn�t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
1593	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.� The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1�s Juice factory. The text says,�a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.� These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3		3																					
1594	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men�s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He�s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men�s directions. He�s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they�ve lost it. 	2	2		2																					
1595	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much.	3	2		3																					
1597	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the �short cut� that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the �Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. �There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2		2																					
1598	3	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.�	2	2		2																					
1599	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach	1	1		1																					
1600	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.	2	2		2																					
1601	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist�s narrator�s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� Even at his first �ghost town� he just �chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on�. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, �One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men�. He said, �this was troubling�, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, �He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2		3																					
1606	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the �old timers who haven�t left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office�. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded �Welch�s Grape Juice Factory�. Then he saw a sign say �Gary And Wilber�s FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE�RE YOUR BEST BET!�. So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn�t seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.	2	2		2																					
1607	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,�The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke � This meant the heat was getting to him.	1	1		1																					
1609	3	In the story, �Do not exceed postal speed limit,� many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. �Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven�t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.� This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. ��but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. �That smoky blues tune �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.	3	3		3																					
1610	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats � Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit� it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says � In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists�� he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing.	1	1		1																					
1614	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn�t follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don�t go crazy and they don�t really get outdated, and maps don�t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.	2	2		2																					
1619	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn�t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That�s how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1621	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1		1																					
1624	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, �There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.� This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1627	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,� the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt�, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
1630	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.	1	1		1																					
1634	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,"" still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2�@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"". Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found."	3	3		3																					
1636	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn�t cool down it didn�t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1		1																					
1637	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, �This sight was troubling�I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.� With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called �easy way out.� 	1	1		1																					
1639	3	The setting of this Essay is to tell cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.	1	1		1																					
1641	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, �That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.� Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3	3		3																					
1642	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,� the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement �the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them� helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across �one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest make.� This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story �The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.� @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� is used as an important for character development.  	3	3		3																					
1643	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path� it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes� the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� and when he writes �a ridiculously large snake� show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1645	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit� this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1	1		1																					
1646	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, �through the high deserts of California in June.� This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2		2																					
1648	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the �shortcut� he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	2		2																					
1649	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways.	0	1		1																					
1650	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.	2	2		2																					
1651	3	If it�s a good day the cyclist will want to rid. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will.	3	3		3																					
1652	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can�t ask for advice because they�re to old old to give information and wouldn�t know what their talking about. �A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office.� That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.	1	1		1																					
1655	3	In the story �rough road ahead� the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate�. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it�s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.	2	2		2																					
1656	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist�s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1		2																					
1657	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. �The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,� this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1659	3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn�t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch�s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.	3	2		3																					
1664	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
1669	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.	1	1		1																					
1675	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said �rough road ahead� The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.� Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or �ghost town�. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3		3																					
1676	3	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn�t on is side that�s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn�t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.	2	1		2																					
1677	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, �These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,� If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I�m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2		2																					
1678	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, �That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office�. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven�t left their homes in years.	2	2		2																					
1680	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2		2																					
1684	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.	2	2		2																					
1685	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2		2																					
1686	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. �The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1		1																					
1688	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.	0	0		0																					
1690	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2		3																					
1692	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story �Do not exceed the speed limit� when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1693	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist �arrived at the first �town�"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town �town� having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. "	2	2		2																					
1695	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says �The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.� In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affects the cyclist greatly."	2	3		3																					
1696	3	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1697	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed� by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1		1																					
1703	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2		3																					
1704	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed Limit�, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, �haven�t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. �  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the �Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� he was traveling through a barren desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This type of setting could really bring down a cultist�s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better.	1	1		1																					
1707	3	"The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,& he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree & mody for anything. He writes ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion & defect. Here he writes �i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuch them in my mouth with any luck I�d hit a bump of lodge one in my throat.� He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor"	3	3		3																					
1712	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.� @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. �I could make that!� But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don�t make it. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3	2		3																					
1713	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him. He was peddling through the desert�s of California. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn�t very many places to stop for water.	1	1		1																					
1715	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.	2	2		2																					
1716	3	The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, �Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don�t help any eigther.	2	1		2																					
1717	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn�t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch�s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a �young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth� This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1		1																					
1719	3	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.	0	0		0																					
1722	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  	2	2		2																					
1724	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he�s in Lodi, California on a �gorgeous day in June.� It�s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1725	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, �over one crippling hills�� with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn�t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he�ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water.	2	2		2																					
1726	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1728	4	The narrater has that in with Paragraph becuse it all makes sence and it go'ss along together. The narrater says that when the guiss come out and the hibicus is budding is becuse it is ones more agian spring   	0	0		0																					
1730	4	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi�new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.	1	2		2																					
1731	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, �Winter Hibiscus�, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam.	2	2		2																					
1732	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1		1																					
1733	4	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds."	0	0		0																					
1734	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1		2																					
1736	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a good ending. In the story the girl buys a Hibiscus that remainds her of home. She goes home & tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home. "	2	2		2																					
1737	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn�t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn�t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn�t going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story.	2	2		2																					
1739	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph	1	1		1																					
1741	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
1742	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1		1																					
1744	4	The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that�s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.	1	1		1																					
1745	4	"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says �I-I failed the test.� She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to �take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, �while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to �take the test again.� Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test � when the snow melts and the geese return.� The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese."	2	3		3																					
1749	4	 In� Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.	2	3		3																					
1750	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to snow that just because you fail once you  shouldn�t give up.  From  what  was  expressed  it  the  paragraph it  was  implied to me that Saeng  will become  stronger by spring and be able to pass the test .	1	1		1																					
1751	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don�t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.	2	1		2																					
1753	4	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.	1	1		1																					
1755	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says� when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,�she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3		3																					
1758	4	The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn�t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test.	1	1		1																					
1761	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that�s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.	1	1		1																					
1762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don�t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.	2	1		2																					
1764	4	The reason the author of the story �Winter hibiscus� ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don�t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner�s permit test. Also you can�t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.	1	2		2																					
1767	4	The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.� She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.	3	2		3																					
1768	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ��A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden��� @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,�� Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,�� @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2		2																					
1769	4	I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn�t just going to give up, that her failing wasn�t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. �The hibiscus will be budding�   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.	2	2		2																					
1770	4	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. "	1	2		2																					
1772	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when �Saeng vowed silently to herself� it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say �then I will take that test again�. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1773	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2		2																					
1774	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won�t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1		1																					
1776	4	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for saeng. It shows that she will be ready when spring comes. When the plant is ready to bud, she will have faith about taking the test. She'll probably want to take care of the plant before she takes the test. When the plant bads, saeng won�t have to take care of it anymore.	1	1		1																					
1778	4	�Winter Hibiscus �is about a girl saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After she fails her driver�s test. She walks home and finds a hibiscus. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair�� She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home & tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too. The mom is not happy with how much saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden.� When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by.�When the hibiscus returns in the spring,  saeng will take her driver�s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have a new chance to pass her test.	2	2		2																					
1779	4	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She�s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it�s to miss or a misake. For an example �they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.	2	1		2																					
1780	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.� @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."	0	0		0																					
1781	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she�s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.	0	0		0																					
1785	4	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ��when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     	1	2		2																					
1786	4	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a �test� and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real �home� that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say �home� without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.	2	2		2																					
1787	4	In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, �when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again�     	3	2		3																					
1789	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, �the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. �I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  	1	1		1																					
1792	4	I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added �hibiscus is budding.� Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.	1	1		1																					
1794	4	In this story Saeng shows her mother how pasionate she is with planting and her pasionate for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the charact Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says �I will try this test again� meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased.	0	0		0																					
1796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
1798	4	The author is saying that she�s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
1800	4	The author might have concluded this story because it like a downfall. Which mean like right now he�s at the bottom and got to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but thes time he is not going to fail.	1	1		1																					
1806	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
1811	4	I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.	0	0		0																					
1812	4	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote �In the spring�then I will take that test again.� In the text, the girl says �it�s-it�s not a real one,� when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote �� much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."	2	3		3																					
1813	4	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader �if you just try, you might like it,� and that�s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again.	0	0		0																					
1814	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1816	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn�t give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph.	1	1		1																					
1817	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  	1	1		1																					
1820	4	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.	1	1		1																					
1821	4	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.	2	2		2																					
1823	4	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn�t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.	3	2		3																					
1824	4	The authoR concludes thEy stoRy with thE paRagraph bEcause in thE bEing oF the stoRy heR Family movEd to thE United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home FRom Failing heR dRivER's test. She See a FamiliaR plant. Later she goes to a FloRist shop to see iF thE plant can be puRchased. So she gEt thE plant seeds and plant thEm so when they staRt to bloom she will go to heR dRiving test she Failed. I @CAPS1 she use the FoR good luck That is why I @CAPS1 the authoR conclude that paragRaph in thE stoRy.	1	1		1																					
1825	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now� & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.	1	1		1																					
1826	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She trys doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. Thats why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not.	2	2		2																					
1827	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don�t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
1828	4	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.	0	0		0																					
1829	4	 The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ��Winter Hibiscus�� with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over��� In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ��take that test again��� By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ��@CAPS1 of loss.�� and to her grief.      	2	2		2																					
1831	4	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.	2	1		2																					
1833	4	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.	2	2		2																					
1835	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, �When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
1836	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.	2	2		2																					
1837	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the @CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons �reluctantly� that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of @LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.  	3	2		3																					
1838	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her �budding� will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle.	3	2		3																					
1840	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn�t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
1843	4	�When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The story �winter hibiscus� ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� Saeng is the winter hibiscus that�s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won�t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That�s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng�s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It�s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.	3	3		3																					
1844	4	I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.	1	1		1																					
1845	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3		3																					
1847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again."	2	2		2																					
1848	4	The auther ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding  Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles.	1	1		1																					
1850	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
1852	4	The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness from home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. The plant will budd at the time the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This line implies that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place. when the budds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test. She will be more confident.	1	2		2																					
1853	4	The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys.	1	1		1																					
1854	4	"There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"" this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familier plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. "" where did you get it?"" her mother aasked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well. When Saeng's mother felt have from thr plants made Saeng happy and gave her courage the driver's test again. is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. "	3	3		3																					
1857	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0		0																					
1858	4	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.	0	0		0																					
1865	4	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 – All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this “When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesn’t want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph	2	2		2																					
1866	4	The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng�s plant but also for her life in a different country.	1	2		2																					
1870	4	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.	3	2		3																					
1871	4	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng�s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�� @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, �it�s not like the kind we had before.� But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  	2	2		2																					
1873	4	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tell�s her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the story�s paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1875	4	In the story �� Winter Hibiscus,�� the author concludes the story with this paragraph  for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng  will not give up, she  will wait for next time  to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list  of  confidence in passing  this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her  for it and it shows Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said �let�s plant it, right now,�� T his example shows that even though Saeng had failed the the test and disapointed her mother,she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant just like how her mother has hope for Saeng.         	2	2		2																					
1876	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it.	1	1		1																					
1878	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, �When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   	2	2		2																					
1880	4	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life	3	3		3																					
1886	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So it�s a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
1887	4	It�s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.	1	1		1																					
1892	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1		1																					
1893	4	The author concludes the ending as �I will take that test again� meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� she is thinking of the feature and how she �saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can�t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.	2	2		2																					
1895	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to	1	1		1																					
1896	4	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.	1	1		1																					
1897	4	"In this story theauther deicides to end the story with this paragraphe, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien."" because she wants to take the test when every thing is isanters, de forexample she wants everything she likes in her nuforment such as the flowers, the geese and the whether. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1899	4	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do.	3	2		3																					
1900	4	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason."	0	0		0																					
1901	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes his story with an odd ending. ��when they come back,� Saeng vowed silently to herself,�in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.�� I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver�s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. �She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..� I believe that this is showing that she still didn�t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3		3																					
1902	4	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng wont stop, just because she faild one first time. It also shows that she is not going to let certaint things keep her down.	1	1		1																					
1909	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0		0																					
1910	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he�s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1		1																					
1911	4	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng fills. In the paragraph Saeng said ""I will take that test again"" means will I go throught the same stuff. Also @CAPS1"	1	1		1																					
1913	4	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it�s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes.	1	2		2																					
1915	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can�t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. 	2	2		2																					
1916	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus� used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. �The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, �she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.	3	3		3																					
1918	4	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.	1	1		1																					
1920	4	The author didn�t think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind of gardening since she didn�t have any friends in school she didn�t want to go their the would have nobody to talk to its good that Saeng vowed because she will never know if she would do good or bad, So the author realized that Saeng will take the test and pass.	0	0		0																					
1921	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
1922	4	After reading the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants �dok faeng-noi,� has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.	2	3		3																					
1923	4	The author concludes. the story with this paragraph to show the story about snows on the roads. He shows people how to watch where they are going. In conclusion, the paragraph would show he made through the snow storm.	0	0		0																					
1926	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
1927	4	The auther cncludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscuss is	1	1		1																					
1929	4	The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that.	1	1		1																					
1932	4	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
1934	4	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.	1	1		1																					
1935	4	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she�ll survive also. Although the flower isn�t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she�ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     	2	2		2																					
1937	4	"I belive that the author included this paragraph to show that you she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after she failed. Saeng said to her mother ""I failed the test"". Also to make her sound proud and happy to try the test over again. Also I have failed test. I also said that I would take them over but I didn't. So the author put that in their to show how determin she was going to sound."	1	1		1																					
1938	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.� The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once �this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again� because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver�s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.	3	2		3																					
1939	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng �vowed� to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. �Winter Hibiscus� is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.	3	2		3																					
1940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.	0	0		0																					
1942	4	Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she can do much better than before. And she made a vowed to herself saying that once winter finally ends and spring start, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors.	1	1		1																					
1943	4	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn�t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.	1	2		2																					
1945	4	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beggining, Saeng says, �I � I failed the test.� She is also really sad, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test.	1	2		2																					
1948	4	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,	2	2		2																					
1952	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archotyal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted here she believes that maybe when she sees the plant florishing and she geese returning, she will experience that same revival again.	2	2		2																					
1953	4	"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story).  I think this because Saeng  learned that she has  to get used to hung in @LOCATION1 and the plant remainded her  that she has to when  she saw the geese fly in the ""V""formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that its prayer to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back,and the hibiscus is budding. This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng.                                                                                                       "	2	2		2																					
1954	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph show is that Saeng is willing to try again to try to get a plant that will remind her of her grand mother and  remind her of her old home where she @MONTH1 go back one day . So, she can see the near flower she loves and not the take   one.	1	1		1																					
1955	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn�t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. �Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.� This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1		2																					
1956	4	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.	0	0		0																					
1959	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.	1	2		2																					
1966	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its showing she still has hope. The hibiscus gives her hope and strength. In the spring she will take her test again and will hope to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1969	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1		1																					
1971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saeng�s life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.	1	1		1																					
1972	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good.	0	0		0																					
1975	4	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.	2	2		2																					
1978	4	The author concludes the �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she�s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of are strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season familiar to her now.�  This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain same. This also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. The narrator also said, �Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.� This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the  of pressure to pass, and of a new is ready to pass the test. But she�ll be more prepared. The theme of this story could be seen things discourage you. The narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons.	3	2		3																					
1980	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did.	2	2		2																					
1981	4	The aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph. In same ways. One reason why the aurthor concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom, Then her mom look at her weird, because in the story it said that �you what? Her mother stared at her increously.� So then she explains that she failed the drivers test, but she didn�t give up. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again. So in conclusion that is why the aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1984	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author end the story saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter what Saeng failed the drive test the first time she is not gaving up till she pass and get her driving. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
1988	4	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because she wants to test the hibiscus again when it returns. FOR evidence in the last paragraph it says, �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return And this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� That�s why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.    	0	0		0																					
1990	4	In the short story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ��When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again��(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        	2	2		2																					
1991	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
1992	4	Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test agin. And she will try harder next time.	1	1		1																					
1994	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
1998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2																					
1999	4	They author had conclued that sentence to be the coucluding sentence because saeng thinks she deserve another chance at taking the garden test because she has failed the test before  then having her mother to be disappointed in her. And to what Saeng say at the end of the story is that she's gonna have more confidence in doing the garden test again.	1	1		1																					
2001	4	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of �home�. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn�t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.	3	3		3																					
2002	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
2003	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it�s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It�s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.	0	0		0																					
2005	4	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2006	4	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.	1	1		1																					
2007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her. � Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2008	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I�d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2		2																					
2009	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of �Winter Hibiscus� means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1		1																					
2010	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
2011	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just fell her driving test. 	1	1		1																					
2014	4	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom �I failed�� When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.	1	1		1																					
2015	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said �Then I will take that tes again�, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don�t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season�. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she�ll do great.	1	2		2																					
2017	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the �winter hibiscus� and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1																					
2019	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won�t give up if they don�t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.	2	1		2																					
2020	4	 I think the author concludes the story the way hedid is becuse it will make people wownt to read the next story to see if the test is past it add suspenes to the story	1	1		1																					
2023	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 	0	0		0																					
2025	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when every thing returns to normol and the �geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again.� meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2026	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn�t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.	2	2		2																					
2028	4	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  	2	1		2																					
2031	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.� This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation.	2	1		2																					
2032	4	I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn�t melt in the spring geese don�t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    	0	0		0																					
2034	4	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when it�s the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant.	2	2		2																					
2035	4	The author conludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseveriance Saeng has. Also it tells a lot about her carter and ends the story in a strong mood. That is why she ended the story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2036	4	When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.	0	0		0																					
2037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the auther felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing liner driver test, she sees a familiar plant. later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased That she will take the test again because she feel as thought she is confident to past it the next time around.	1	1		1																					
2038	4	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn�t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng�s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    	3	2		3																					
2042	4	Will you no in the spring the snows melt and the grass is not pretty and it�s a muddy grass for the pigs who love to now in mud how about a mud  hath ford see what winter can do to you have about the tree now weight leave to live etc good life	0	0		0																					
2043	4	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says �overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).� @CAPS1 when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an �omelet with slices of bitter melon� made her math water, @CAPS1 reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.	1	1		1																					
2044	4	Saeng love Flowers and plants. The Author concludes this paragraph in the stony because it go Along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts.Saeng waS waiting For winter to beover so she can see he plants and Flowers again. Saeng like the values of plants and enjoy planting them. The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn�t wait a new winter break was over.	0	0		0																					
2045	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.	2	1		2																					
2047	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   	1	1		1																					
2048	4	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you don�t sucede, try try again. Also the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam.	1	1		1

2052	4	I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try�s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.	1	1		1																					
2053	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with �When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time.

So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn�t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn�t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.	3	2		3																					
2055	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.	1	1		1																					
2056	4	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country.

2062	4	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either.

This ending shows the determination in Saeng�s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1		1																					
2080	4	The author of the story �winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, �When they come back�in the spring� then I will take that test again�.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,��in the spring�when�this hibiscus is budding��(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3		3

2083	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again�. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she�ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.	3	3		3																					
2087	4	�Winter Hibiscus�, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home.

For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time.

When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland."	2	2		2																					
2118	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus.� The author ends the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says �like the geese the distinctive V against the sky.� That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in.	3	2		3																					
2119	4	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn�t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,� don�t  give  up.�	1	2		2																					
2123	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.	3	3		3																					
2126	4	In the story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� the author ends the story with Saeng �s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn�t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. 	3	2		3																					
2127	4	In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver�s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. �And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. �Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2128	4	Why the counclude the story saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will will take that test again is to leave suspense. But he mean that saeng ate all the plant so next year she will have the test not to eat it. This is why the author ended the story with that.	1	1		1																					
2132	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng�s problem is her �wave of loss� that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng�s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2135	4	They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say.	0	0		0																					
2140	4	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that�s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always �hear� that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that�s why he concluded the story as such. 	2	2		2																					
2141	4	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscuc. The hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts. So she will go take the test again and us the hibiscus as her modifation.	2	1		2																					
2142	4	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng�s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng�s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.	1	1		1																					
2143	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it�s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
2144	4	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test �She said, �I�I failed the test.� By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start.	2	2		2																					
2145	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn�t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1		2																					
2147	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
2150	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn�t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. It shows that she doesn�t regret buying the hibiscus.  	1	2		2																					
2151	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus � this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as �The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.� The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through the cold months here�. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her�. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3		3																					
2152	4	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting.  Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement.	0	0		0																					
2153	4	The author concluded the story will this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn�t give up on the plant and that she�s determine. For example the story state that Saeng said �I-I failed the test,� She felt as though she didn�t accomplish what she wanted to. So at the end of the story she said �I will take that test again.� To show what kind of person she is and she not going to just give up just because she failed the first time.	2	1		2																					
2154	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say�s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.� This reminds her of her old home watching the geese."	2	2		2																					
2157	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn�t pass the test, but then soon forget about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it.	1	1		1																					
2161	4	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver�s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again	1	2		2																					
2162	4	She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.	1	1		1																					
2163	4	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,� She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,�  � almost familiar to her now ,� She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2165	4	�When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don�t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn�t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.	1	0		1																					
2168	4	The author conclude the story with �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�.because she wanted to grow hibiscus in the winter time. She had failed the first time and she wanted to redeem herself and do it the second time arround. She didn�t want to fail again so she did some things differently. She planted it with care patted the soil down firmly around the plant. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2169	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2																					
2170	4	"�then I will take that test again� [@NUM1] Saeng�s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the �@CAPS2 Malik� [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life �back home� [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, �when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�"	1	2		2																					
2172	4	"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that ""saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t"	2	2		2																					
2175	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled �jasmine�, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is �not a real one� and she also says it�s �not like the kind we had before.� @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2176	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because the story is coming to and end. The author putting that sweet touch on its saying it will become string again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.	0	0		0																					
2178	4	" Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought� a plant it was the ""dok faeng � noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought �@CAPS1 hibiscus� as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,� �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."	2	2		2																					
2182	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: �it�s-it�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. �Not like the kind we had before� I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng�s position perfectly � she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in �winter hibiscus� to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.	3	2		3																					
2186	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.	1	1		1																					
2187	4	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.	0	0		0																					
2188	4	The author concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus � the way she did because she wanted to show saeng �s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, �she was still too shaky to say the words at home �.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she�d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,�I failed the test �, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng�s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in �winter Hibiscus� is used to show saeng�s determination.	3	3		3																					
2190	4	"The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, �Saeng"", a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, �Saebba"", Saeng whispered, �Madagascar periwinkle�, its tag pronounced. �How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild.!! But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the �hibiscus"". In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance."	3	2		3																					
2193	4	The short story �winter Hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator�s hope, �Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that alot of things to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start. The conclusion sentence of �Winter Hibiscus� is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning.	2	2		2																					
2194	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying,� ... I will take the test again.� In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.	2	2		2																					
2197	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1		1																					
2199	4	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It�s almost as if she�s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng �realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she�ll have a different outlook on her new life.	2	2		2																					
2200	4	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how �Beautiful or calming� spring supposively is.	1	1		1																					
2201	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggest that her strength will come when the flowers come and she will be able to take the test.	1	1		1																					
2202	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
2203	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn�t stop budding so Saeng shouldn�t stop trying!	2	1		2																					
2204	4	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says �Its flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng�s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 	3	3		3																					
2206	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is �@CAPS1 give up.� @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.	1	1		1																					
2208	4	She should and needs too learn that you can�t replace a plant with the same thing and expect it too be as equal too it. She needs too learn that lesson in life.	0	0		0																					
2214	4	I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.	0	0		0																					
2215	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do.	2	1		2																					
2217	4	Saeng failed her driver�s test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She sates, �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long grey hair.� The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, �??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make through the cold months.� She�s trying to make her daughter feel better. It states, �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.�	2	2		2																					
2218	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again	1	1		1																					
2219	4	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new	1	1		1																					
2222	4	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test & not the planting.	0	0		0																					
2223	4	I think she ended the story with that because throout the wole story she trys to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that its not over, That she will be back to take the test again. She trys to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants  	1	1		1																					
2226	4	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2227	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because with saeng making a goal, she�s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that�s important in life and that�s why the ended it the way they did. It�s a positive ending."	2	2		2																					
2231	4	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter. and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.	1	1		1																					
2232	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said “I-I failed the test,” I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   	1	1		1																					
2236	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test.	1	1		1																					
2237	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn�t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1		1																					
2239	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.	2	2		2																					
2243	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1		2																					
2245	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland,When  the familiar things return ,she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says �Overhead a of Canada geese flew by,their faint hunks clear and �yes-fimiliar to Saeng now �.This shows how the geese are a symbol of the fimilar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home.	1	2		2																					
2251	4	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.	1	1		1																					
2254	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn�t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
2256	4	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.	0	0		0																					
2257	4	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms	1	1		1																					
2258	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can�t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2259	4	I think that the authoR includes this paRagRaph in this stoRy b/c the gRandmothER might think that it is a tEst to sEE what she can gEt donE @CAPS1 time. The gRandmotheR might gEt more done then should @CAPS2.	0	0		0																					
2261	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2262	4	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.	2	2		2																					
2263	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng�s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2265	4	Including the bit about taking the test again when the �hidiscus is budding� provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn�t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
2266	4	The  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph  � When  they  come  back  ,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  I  will  take  the   test  again ,�  because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  Saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  Saeng  is  reminded  from  the  Hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  After  Saeng  wanted  the  Hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,�  a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by �,  as  they  flew  by  Saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
2267	4	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.	0	0		0																					
2268	4	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn�t forgotten her heritage. �But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.� It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She�s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.	2	2		2																					
2270	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that�s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                	2	1		2																					
2276	4	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.	0	0		0																					
2277	4	In the story I don�t know why the author and the story with that I really don�t know, maybe she was talking about she took all test now she wouldn�t take it over again atey. The times come. She in school and when one took the test of was that kind of wealth now that of not of is @DATE1 and school is over. 	0	0		0																					
2278	4	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.	0	0		0																					
2281	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� paragraph because like this the plant didn�t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.	1	1		1																					
2282	4	"Emotion, camitmint, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1, that last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph."	2	1		2																					
2283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, �she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.� At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to �bloom.� @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to �bloom.� 	3	2		3																					
2285	4	Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she�s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, �and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2288	4	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again� to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author�s conclusion was �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  	2	2		2																					
2290	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng�s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2292	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states �when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.	1	2		2																					
2293	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng�s mother states, ""�it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months�. That�s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
2295	4	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that its not over, and even though the test was a failure, it wont be next time. The author leads is know that the little girl cares about the test, and wants to prove to show people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite.	2	2		2																					
2297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2298	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you�ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.	2	2		2																					
2299	4	Saeng was taking a test and she didn�t quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn�t pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, She�ll be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.	1	1		1																					
2300	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- �I mean its not the kind we at-at-� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home.	3	2		3																					
2305	4	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, saying that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again thats when I will take that test and pass this time.	1	1		1																					
2306	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, �Its not a real one�  ""Not like the kind we had before.� Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."	2	1		2																					
2307	4	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2308	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelingsshe gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2312	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say �I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1		1																					
2316	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2319	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.	2	3		3																					
2325	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
2326	4	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn�t main the she will alway have hard times.	0	0		0																					
2329	4	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning	2	2		2																					
2331	4	The author includes this scentence, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.	1	1		1																					
2332	4	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2334	4	The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that overtime when she is adapted well to every thing she will be able to take the test, so that�s why she says ��and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,�� �@CAPS1 that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow. Also the paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story.	1	1		1																					
2335	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saeng�s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence."	3	2		3																					
2337	4	She concludes that paragraph with the story because she realy wants the people to realize that she is and and is always having fun. Also that she love where she at. Shes making in the world and she loves wathing flower, �geese return and this hibiscus is budding� that show that her favorite thing to do  that she loves is flowers.	0	0		0																					
2338	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. �I will  take that test again,� This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,� when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,� is referring to when she says,� She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become � almost familiar to her. Like the geese,� She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.� When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.� When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center �just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."	1	2		2																					
2340	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. �She was still too shaky to say at home� she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.�  	2	1		2																					
2341	4	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don�t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.	1	1		1																					
2343	4	I belive that saeng made that silent vow to herself was because after the plant goes though the hard winter and once everything goes back to how she likes it and the plant starts budding again, that that kind of represents her hardtime with moving so if this plant that she loves so much can make it through it then she can too.	1	1		1																					
2345	4	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus�s bids, and the return of Saeng�s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn�t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng�s past, as portrayed when the author writes: �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.� The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.	2	2		2																					
2347	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng�s �comfort tone� is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. 	3	2		3																					
2350	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. 	0	0		0																					
2351	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng�s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn�t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says �will take that test again�she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
2355	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �When they come back take that test again. �She does this to show that she still has hope, and won�t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. �@CAPS1 I will take that test again.� (shows hope).�And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  	2	2		2																					
2356	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  	2	1		2																					
2357	4	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it nexttime So she doesn't make her mother dissapointed in her.	1	1		1																					
2358	4	I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY.	0	0		0																					
2359	4	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, the snows melt, this means that the seasons will keep going, just as Saeng should keep going and trying. Also when the author says and the geese return, this means that the geese will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test.	2	2		2																					
2362	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.	2	2		2																					
2364	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2366	4	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.	1	2		2																					
2367	4	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng�s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother �s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn�t  home she said � I failed the test .� This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn�t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.	1	2		2																					
2368	4	In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a since of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe that�s why she ended the story like she did so she doesn�t leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
2369	4	The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-�. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does.	2	2		2																					
2370	4	Many authors end their storys in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says �I will take that test again.� This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� see she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen.	2	2		2																					
2375	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saeng�s mother says,�'�but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That�s what matters.� This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The driver�s test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isn�t The same as she was back home, but she�s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng�s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says �...When the snows melt...� it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down.	3	3		3																					
2377	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are �familiar to Saeng now � despite her thinking of them as �strange before.� The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng�s vow that she will �take that test again� in the spring, �When the snows melt��etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng�s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author�s wording was very well done.	3	3		3																					
2380	4	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.	0	0		0																					
2386	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
2388	4	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.	2	1		2																					
2391	4	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.	1	1		1																					
2395	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1		1																					
2398	4	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.	0	0		0																					
2399	4	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.	0	0		0																					
2401	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.	2	1		2																					
2402	4	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.	0	0		0																					
2404	4	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.	1	1		1																					
2405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.	1	1		1																					
2407	4	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.	0	0		0																					
2409	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don�t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn�t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2		2																					
2411	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2414	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng�s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she�s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, �It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.�	2	2		2																					
2415	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																					
2417	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2		2																					
2418	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt. 	2	2		2																					
2419	4	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it�s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  	1	1		1																					
2422	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
2424	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3		3																					
2425	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																					
2426	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain�t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2427	4	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you don�t put the solution any whereelse but the end that is why she put it there.	0	0		0																					
2429	4	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.	2	3		3																					
2430	4	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.	0	0		0																					
2431	4	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver�s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will �return� to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. �I paid nineteen dollars for  it�. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.	3	2		3																					
2435	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2		2																					
2436	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (�Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world�) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says �I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2440	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph says� When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test. In the text it states �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She was realizing that it wasn�t so bad & she was getting used to it."	2	2		2																					
2442	4	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring. The way she speaks of the test shows her determination. The use of the word �vowed� shows she will follow through with her statement.	1	1		1																					
2444	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower is told about all through the story and the author puts when the hubiscius is budding then I will take that test again.	0	0		0

2451	4	The author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see�s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a �You what?� hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1		2																					
2453	4	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living."""	0	0		0																					
2454	4	The author concludes the story with �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																					
2455	4	 I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. 	1	1		1																					
2457	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. �Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver�s test.	2	2		2																					
2462	4	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era�s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2464	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																					
2465	4	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, �It�s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can�t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																					
2468	4	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, �I know"", her mother said quietly. �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It�s flower aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																					
2469	4	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now �familiar to her�. The narrator of the story says, �..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, � A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.�, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as �old friends�, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.	3	3		3																					
2474	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0		0																					
2477	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. ��when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn�t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese�s and hibiscus�s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																					
2478	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. 	1	1		1																					
2479	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																					
2483	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response �I-I failed the test� Saeng said.� This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.	0	0		0																					
2484	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.� Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2485	4	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn�t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.	1	1		1																					
2486	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back ��to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, �walking into another world.� As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the �familiar fragrance �which �filled her lungs .� It was even difficult for saeng to say the words �at home� without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  	3	2		3																					
2488	4	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on	0	0		0																					
2490	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																					
2492	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus �ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story �it�s the flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That�s what matters.� I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																					
2493	4	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. �I � I failed the test� She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test"	2	2		2																					
2494	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.	0	0		0																					
2497	4	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.	1	1		1																					
2499	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																					
2504	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. � ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																					
2507	4	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. "	2	2		2																					
2509	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1		1																					
2512	4	"At the end of the short start �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng says �when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start �plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. �She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  "	2	2		2																					
2515	4	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.	0	0		0																					
2517	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. �Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye�    "	0	0		0																					
2518	4	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2521	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																					
2523	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1		1																					
2524	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2525	4	In the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the winter hits and the plant she likes will disappear and the flower gave her good luck so she said �when the snow melt in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The flower was very important to her. She said, �that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too. She was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell, it was the same.	2	1		2																					
2526	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.	0	0		0																					
2527	4	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.	1	1		1																					
2528	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she�s not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.	1	1		1																					
2530	4	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself In the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibicus budding then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
2531	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus� by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. �She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.� She can�t say home because home isn�t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion�s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does	3	3		3																					
2532	4	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, �as the snow melts away;��,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, �exploding, shock ,intense� and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng�s hope for a better future, even though things aren�t the way they were back home!	2	3		3																					
2534	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2535	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, �� she noticed the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes�[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ��she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac�[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ��she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now �[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																					
2536	4	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2538	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong. Therefore, she will take the test when they return. She thinks she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are in her life.	1	1		1																					
2539	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school.	0	0		0																					
2544	4	"Minfong tto ended the story with aphrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity. "	2	2		2																					
2545	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, �then I will take that test again.� Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2547	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don�t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.	1	1		1																					
2548	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said �she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre�. And that�s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  	1	1		1																					
2549	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,	1	1		1																					
2550	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																					
2551	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.	0	0		0																					
2552	4	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end	0	0		0																					
2553	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with that sentence b/c she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season.	1	1		1																					
2557	4	I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to perservere.	0	0		0																					
2559	4	In the story the author concludes with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she did that to say that you shouldn�t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and �touched a petal.� She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																					
2560	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were �strange before [and] had become familiar to her now�. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																					
2565	4	"Saeng vowed siletly to herself ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. She says "" One of the blossoms had fallen off"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus"" into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family"""	1	1		1																					
2567	4	Thes basically say that he will be around again just like the geese always come back.	0	0		0																					
2568	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfor table about talking about her old home ��She was still to make to say the words at home�� [HO] so the snow melting the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Second remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng   says �� Just as she known it would feel� �� Back home it Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs�� [HO].So with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, w hen she is confident and strong.   	2	1		2																					
2571	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. �Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."	2	2		2																					
2573	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1		1																					
2574	4	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.� means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story."	1	1		1																					
2575	4	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests�. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that�s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys."	2	1		2																					
2578	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story �Winter Hibiscus�. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself� but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last �vowe� is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says �and this hibiscus is budding� its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																					
2579	4	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that �why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.	1	1		1																					
2580	4	After they come Saeng  was  silently  to herself , In the spring , when the snows melt  and  the geese return and  the hibiscus  is Saeng  then  I am  take that test again.  She  say this sentence she is herself back to home .She  thinks  it familiar to Saeng  was. She  is herself  how  quiet it vowed  to  so  every season . Her live is very quiet and leavy . She feels  as  of place .  Due to failing her driving test things herself  was thing for her to united state was so different from vietnam and she expresses  her  feelings  will she talk a about this something flower.   	1	1		1																					
2581	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.	1	1		1																					
2582	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2583	4	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.	2	2		2																					
2584	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn�t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying �live in the moment�. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that�s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																					
2586	4	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe �the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.	1	1		1																					
2594	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test."	1	2		2																					
2595	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																					
2596	4	The author added the story in with this paragraph for a lot reasons and to make the story longer, and two to show that even if you screw up the first time you can still try again.	1	1		1																					
2597	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																					
2598	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1		1																					
2599	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																					
2601	4	�In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again� Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																					
2604	4	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.	2	3		3																					
2607	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said � I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  	1	1		1																					
2608	4	She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.	0	0		0																					
2609	4	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.	1	2		2																					
2610	4	ThE author concludEs the story with this paragraph bEcausE mEans that whEn thE shovEl grow again in the spring, whEn thE snow mElts and the gEEsE rEturn and this hibiscus is budding shE will takE thE tEst again. So shE will wait until thE nExt spring to takE thE tEst..	1	1		1																					
2612	4	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																					
2613	4	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past	1	1		1																					
2614	4	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story �Winter Hibiscus� the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would�ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that �Winter Hibiscus� was concluded in this way.	2	2		2																					
2615	4	At the end of the essay �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1		2																					
2619	4	"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn�t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, �.In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says �hibiscus is budding�, and �the geese return�, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that �In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1		1																					
2627	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says �Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, �How strang to see it in apat,� Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.� This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.	1	2		2																					
2628	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized � all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																					
2632	4	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say �it can make through  the  cold months. � @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says �Not like the same kind we had before.�This implies that it different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally it says, �this hibiscus is budding� which means she will bloom.	2	2		2																					
2633	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																					
2635	4	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. �In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,� all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,� she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can�t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.	0	0		0																					
2638	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     	2	2		2																					
2639	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It�s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2640	4	The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.	1	0		1																					
2642	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now."	2	1		2																					
2643	4	"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn�t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say�s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.�"	1	1		1																					
2649	4	The last paragraph of �Winter Hibiscus� describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when �this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.� Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can�t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2		2																					
2650	4	"The Author of �Winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. �I mean it�s not like the kind we had at � at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																					
2651	4	"The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's"" the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."	1	1		1																					
2656	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she�s grew up more and maybe she�ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. �hibiscus is budding� this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																					
2657	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.	1	2		2																					
2658	4	The author concludes this story with �when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didnt past her test and knew her mom would be mad so that why she got the flower. If she wouldn�t have failed her test she probably wouldn�t have got the flower in the first place.	1	1		1																					
2660	4	She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows it�s inner budding she will to. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. ��vowed silently to herself �then I will take that test again.��       	2	2		2																					
2661	4	In the story �winter @CAPS1� the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She�s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can�t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2663	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1		1																					
2665	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2668	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same envioronment and everything she wanted before when she took the test	0	0		0																					
2669	4	The author�s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2670	4	The Author @CAPS1 the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she & fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.  	1	1		1																					
2673	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said �Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow� This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																					
2675	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love�s nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 	1	1		1																					
2679	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng �failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng �felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.	2	2		2																					
2681	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, �hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is �strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver�s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, �in the spring� I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.	2	3		3																					
2683	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she�ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   	2	3		3																					
2686	4	The author includes this  because he�s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng�s personal life is	0	0		0																					
2687	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng�s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom�s gardening, she says, �Here, let me help, mother,� because her mom�s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, �Saeng didn�t dare look her mother in the eye,� which shows Saeng�s concern for her mother�s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, �It�s a beautiful plant, I�m glad you got it,� which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng�s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story�s conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2689	4	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory�s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.	1	2		2																					
2690	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  	3	3		3																					
2692	4	The author @PERSON1, concludes the story ��Winter Hibiscus with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over��� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�@CAPS1 to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, She is making on effort and ��take that test again��� By relating the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to the �� @CAPS2 of loss.�� and to her grief.     	2	2		2																					
2696	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she�s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she�s not giving up ��then I will take that teat again� which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2697	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.	2	1		2																					
2698	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
2699	4	The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph b/c she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did 	1	2		2																					
2703	4	The author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter & and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  	1	1		1																					
2704	4	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng�s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she�s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.	2	2		2																					
2706	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
2708	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, �Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile� That atleast, she could hold onto.� After failing her driver�s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must �blossom� in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3		3																					
2709	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement.."	1	1		1																					
2710	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.� She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																					
2711	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																					
2713	4	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, � @CAPS1  of loss so deep� �(@NUM1) and at the end it says, � I will take that test again.� (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , � almost familiar to her now.�(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.	2	2		2																					
2714	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don�t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.�"	1	0		1																					
2715	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
2718	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this is what the story was all about. Saeng saw what happens in the winter and when it comes back around she trys to memorize it so that she can no what will happen.	0	0		0																					
2719	4	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2720	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2		2																					
2721	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home� 	2	2		2																					
2722	4	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn�t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   	3	2		3																					
2724	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.	1	1		1																					
2725	4	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.	1	1		1																					
2726	4	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"". she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her. After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. "	2	2		2																					
2728	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2729	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																					
2730	4	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. 	1	1		1																					
2731	4	Reserved need to check keenly	3	3		3																					
2732	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold	0	0		0																					
2733	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn�t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.    	2	2		2																					
2735	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.	1	2		2																					
2738	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn�t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																					
2739	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she�s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now�. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn�t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  	2	2		2																					
2740	4	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again.	1	1		1																					
2742	4	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right."	1	1		1																					
2744	4	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasn�t real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasn�t gonna give up on herself.	1	1		1																					
2745	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the �metaphor� compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    	1	2		2																					
2747	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says �In the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she�ll pass it.	1	1		1																					
2749	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.	1	1		1																					
2753	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.	1	1		1																					
2760	4	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.	1	2		2																					
2761	4	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she�s showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistake�s and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
2762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it�ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she�ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she�ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she�ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.	2	1		2																					
2764	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says �That at least she could hold on to� meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said �where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																					
2766	4	The author concludes the story like this because it show that she is determined to do pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test.	1	1		1																					
2768	4	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn�t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, �but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.� thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
2769	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she�s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																					
2775	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng�s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. �it was like walking into another world,� said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.  	2	3		3																					
2778	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng with move with it. The paragraph says, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new sorroundings. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng�s determination to succeed and survive in the new world.	2	3		3																					
2779	4	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegteble patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.	1	1		1																					
2782	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1		1																					
2785	4	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.	1	1		1																					
2787	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																					
2788	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say �at home.� When she says �and this hibiscus is budding,� I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a �V� so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																					
2790	4	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this �test� to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.	1	1		1																					
2792	4	I believe the author ended the story with the �test� because it is a big part of Saeng�s life or part of her tradition.	1	1		1																					
2793	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2		2																					
2794	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																					
2797	4	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus. 	0	0		0																					
2799	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																					
2801	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2																					
2805	4	"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. "	0	0		0																					
2806	4	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows a impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. �not even @PERSON1, looked it."" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don�t give them good. work ethic and that will essue them mentally also. Therefore the girl is not comfortable and not enthused To  working on something that none woud appreciate."	1	1		1																					
2807	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes �she vowed silently to herself.� When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																					
2808	4	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won�t spend so much time dreaming about her past. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.	1	1		1																					
2809	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she�l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn�t happy and changed her mood.	1	1		1																					
2811	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2812	4	Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it�s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   	1	1		1																					
2813	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver�s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																					
2814	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with �When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2		2																					
2816	4	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. �@CAPS1 plant  it right now� is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.	0	0		0																					
2817	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness  for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one. Big @CAPS1  that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the �test� again, that she will do what she is supposed to do 	1	1		1																					
2820	4	I will take that test aGain. She has @CAPS1 confidence From The hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and hibiscus buds. Then she will Go aGain kind oF GrowinG with the hibiscus so an in all she is @CAPS2 to have enouGh conFidence For the test.	1	1		1																					
2823	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
2826	4	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn�t believe it. She didn�t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2829	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."	2	2		2																					
2831	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
2834	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
2835	4	I think that this is about winter hiliscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. 	0	0		0																					
2836	4	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, �... this hibiscus is budding ...� (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, �... I will take the test again� (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) 	2	2		2																					
2837	4	The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says �.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ��@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     	2	3		3																					
2841	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. Whats its saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother. In conclusion that what I have to say about the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2843	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says �this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn�t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance."	2	2		2																					
2845	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2846	4	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.	0	0		0																					
2847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
2848	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she�s not going to give up on what she wants to do.	1	1		1																					
2849	4	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life.	2	1		2																					
2853	4	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. 	0	0		0																					
2854	4	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2860	4	In the �passage winter Hibiscus� by monfong Ho, the quote � when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states �I � failed the test.� This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The � when they came back�� quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3		3																					
2866	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																					
2870	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take thattest again"". To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, ""then I will take that test again"". This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again.  "	1	1		1																					
2874	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says �many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become�.. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2876	4	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.� Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.	2	2		2																					
2878	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it�s saying that she can�t work in the garden in winter, but �when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,� are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.	0	0		0																					
2881	4	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng�s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng�s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.	2	2		2																					
2886	4	Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferately misses her true home when we are first introduced to young saeng she is in a flourist�s shop simply looking at flowers, we soon learn that she is not only  looking at flowers but looking a pieces of her home and past, she then purchases a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests	3	2		3																					
2890	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1		1																					
2891	4	He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.	0	0		0																					
2893	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.� This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.	3	2		3																					
2894	4	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about	1	1		1																					
2899	4	She is talking about the flowers and win she says test I think she means how she looks  and exameans the flowers and see the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is some one how admayers flowers a lot or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buddies. Maybe she is just some one how likes to see changes.	1	1		1																					
2900	4	I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home.	2	2		2																					
2902	4	She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I�ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing.	0	0		0																					
2905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't going to give up.	1	1		1																					
2906	4	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  	0	0		0																					
2907	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1		1																					
2909	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said �You what?� �Her mother stared at her incredulously�. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.	2	2		2																					
2913	4	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying �when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it�s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life.	1	1		1																					
2914	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																					
2916	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says “I- I failed the test” so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																					
2917	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
2918	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
2920	4	"In the story �the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example �when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again�, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																					
2922	4	The author concludes the story with  the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibisous is budding, their i will take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2923	4	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up	0	0		0																					
2924	4	In �Winter Hibiscus�, the author concludes with Saeng saying �I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.	2	1		2																					
2926	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, �it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� @CAPS1 it�s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2927	4	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, �Winter Hibiscus� to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng�s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. �When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    	3	3		3																					
2928	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable.

SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."	2	2		2																					
2929	4	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not �at home,� that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway�s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																					
2930	4	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn�t over come something and I�ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.	1	1		1																					
2933	4	The authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver�s license. In the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. She will feel ready to take her test again �when they came back. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on	2	2		2																					
2937	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, �when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2939	4	The author of�Winter Hibiscus �uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saeng�s future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver�s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   	2	2		2																					
2941	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said �I failed,� talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said �its not like the one at home.� That�s why the author concludes this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2942	4	�When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that�s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.	0	0		0																					
2944	4	In the short story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. �Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?� When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,	0	0		0																					
2948	4	The author finished the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																					
2951	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes �she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs� after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of �combing her grandmother�s long grey hair, freshly washed� it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn�t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was �exquisite� and as she said the @CAPS1 word �dokor malik� meaning hibiscus she �savored the feel of the word on her tongue.� @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when �the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2		3																					
2952	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it�s because it�s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she�ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant�s situation.	2	3		3																					
2954	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story �the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.� you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, �it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her �@CAPS1 Malik� flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  	2	2		2																					
2956	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a �test�,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. �A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng�s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																					
2957	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																					
2960	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																					
2961	4	The auther ended the story with that preticular paragraph because like the geese she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn�t get to finish JUST about everything she wanted to do and that the auther wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also to show the readers that the characters characteristics couldn�t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it untill she does what she has to do.	1	1		1																					
2962	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.� Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng�s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, �then I will take that test again.�you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,�the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																					
2964	4	The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place.	1	1		1																					
2966	4	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,	2	2		2																					
2967	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0		0																					
2968	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the �winter hibiscus� and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling.	1	1		1																					
2969	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     	3	3		3																					
2974	4	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.	1	1		1																					
2975	4	What the author concludes that in the spring time when the snows melts and the flower comes back it makes be risk of spring time at home. Which makes her relax. Also spring time is a more pretty time because all the flowers are out and the flower that reminds her at home blessings.	1	1		1																					
2977	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0		0																					
2978	4	"The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""�in the spring, when the snows melt�."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it."	1	1		1																					
2979	4	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this �test� once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.	2	2		2																					
2980	4	The would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond.	0	0		0																					
2982	4	I believe the author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus�, written by Minfong Ho, with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3		3																					
2984	4	Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2985	4	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother �that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back.	1	1		1																					
2986	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.	0	0		0																					
2987	4	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying. Or thats when the flowers start to bloom.	0	0		0																					
2990	4	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal.	1	1		1																					
2991	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. �But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn�t cost that much!� Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. �Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the �winter hibiscus� into it.� This shows that even though she had failed she wasn�t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																					
2992	4	The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to.	0	0		0																					
2994	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s saying that once winter and spring�s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I�ll start over again and try again. The author is saying saeng can�t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2995	4	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to do over a time period of a year. She is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters. The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself. Over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a phase like the flower. Its opens up to be beautiful again.  "	2	3		3																					
2997	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."	3	2		3																					
2998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the �snow does melt and the Geese return� it will be time t plant and work in the garden even more, because with snow on the ground you can�t plant but the geese back if the time of year to plant the seed and have are bad flock/fasten grander. The test is to she if she can have a better grade than last years, and year befor that.	0	0		0																					
2999	4	The author concluded his storie with that paragraph is because thats how it should end and that�s why he ended it like   that.     	0	0		0																					
3000	4	The author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     	3	3		3																					
3003	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she�ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2		3																					
3007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say �when they come back� talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																					
3008	4	In the conclusion of the �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. When it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3012	4	"Thes Author, In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested."	2	1		2																					
3014	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that �in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,� and everything is beautiful again then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower. The plant with �waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers� will provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will power to pass the test in the spring.	2	2		2																					
3015	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the statement, �...then I�ll take the test again.� This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says �test�. For example, in the story she said, �I-I failed the test,� when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn�t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home.	1	1		1																					
3018	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn�t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2		2																					
3022	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																					
3024	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn�t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng�s determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1		1																					
3026	4	At the end of the story the author says �when they come back in the spring, whe the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.� The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didn�t do her best because she failed so when the spring comes again She is going to retry to do it and hopefully this time she will past.  	1	1		1																					
3027	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back an an do smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return.	0	0		0																					
3028	4	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test.	1	2		2																					
3029	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.	2	1		2																					
3030	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and won�t give up on her test."	1	1		1																					
3031	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won�t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out �I-I failed the test� and couldn�t say �at home� this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																					
3033	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.	1	1		1																					
3035	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																					
3040	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1		2																					
3041	4	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. 	0	0		0																					
3043	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																					
3046	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
3048	4	"In the story �winter Hibiscus� the author Minfong Ho ends with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" she ended with this show her determination to do good in her country and show that memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new country, in her new home. In the beginning of the story Saeng is at a flower shop and she sees all the flowers of her home country growing in poto. At the sight of all these flowers memories flood back to her, memories that bring her joy and sadness. Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, �I-I failed the test  Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye  nervously tore off a leab,shredding it to bits�. After a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the vegetable shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and home. Thinking  about her grandmother helps her to survive for better, helps her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy.  "	3	2		3																					
3049	4	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around.	1	1		1																					
3053	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1		1																					
3056	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng took her driver�s test and failed it. She she wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story say that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back with makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home.  	2	2		2																					
3058	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; �when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.	0	0		0

3063	4	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the paragraph by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids �I-I failed the test.� By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, �The ""winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.� This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2		2																					
3065	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.	0	0		0																					
3067	4	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. � Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral.� A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. �Here, let me help, mother.� In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. �when   they come back  I will take that test again.� As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country she�s in. The main character vowing in �Winter Hibiscus� symbolizes moving   foward.	3	2		3																					
3068	4	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope.	1	1		1																					
3069	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, mabe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention The author also could of concluded the story off with that statement because mabe he Just felt like he need to do that, mabe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it.	0	0		0																					
3070	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"	2	3		3																					
3072	4	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn�t given up on her driving test"	1	1		1																					
3074	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that �never giving up is important� is presented and carried out hopefully through the character�s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2		2																					
3075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn�t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0

The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3078	4	The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.	2	2		2																					
3081	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she�s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																					
3082	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn�t like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2		2

3095	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver�s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																					
3096	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  	2	2		2

Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, �A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.� as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, �Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "	3	3		3																					
3104	4	The author concludes the story with that quote for one main reason. That reason is that it shows that the girl has hope. In a story one of the best qualities a character can have is hope because it makes the reader interested and helps provide a good morale for the Story. That is why the author concludes the story with that quote.	1	1		1

3116	4	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don�t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.	2	2		2																					
3117	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng�s determination and the situation she has now.

After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much �snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. �spring� symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																					
3122	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that�s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1		1																					
3123	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough to make it through the winter. That�s what matters. �Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they �died� as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3

3128	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again also ,to reunite with the plant again. This is a conclusion paragraph that gives insight on what will happen in the future that�s also why the author added this paragraph in.	0	0		0																					
3129	4	The author ends the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, �Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.� This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, �And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too�. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.  	3	3		3																					
3131	4	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says �when they come back�. also when she says �the geese return & this hibiscus is budding�.

3132	4	I think it  was  a  good  enough  by Minfong Ho.Through out the story you feel somewhat happy,and somewhat sad,but always calm.You  feel happy when they are talking about all the  plants and when   her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think  the mom is  going to yell at   her for buying that,after she failed her test.You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up,but just take her time.	1	2		2

3140	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that that saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees @CAPS1 life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam so she plants this @CAPS1 type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that saeng wants to plant her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not siving up but she does not want to take the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph. 	3	2		3																					
3142	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1.the winter hibiscus helped her @CAPS1 with Failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng over come this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.	2	2		2

3147	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver�s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, �when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...� At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																					
3148	4	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai�t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai�t see  her plant.  	0	0		0																					
3152	4	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driver�s test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says �almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they�ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. 	3	2		3																					
3155	4	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is buding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to realy think when she is going to do this again. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
3156	4	In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, �When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. For some reason I think that is affine idea Saeng vowed.	0	0		0																					
3159	4	I think that in the story �Winter Hibiscus� was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end �I will take the test again� so you don�t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																					
3160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you din�t know about.	0	0		0																					
3161	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don�t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don�t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2		2																					
3162	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."	2	2		2																					
3163	4	Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don�t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn�t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over.	1	1		1																					
3164	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver�s test. To Saeng her failing the driver�s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng�s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn�t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2		3																					
3165	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is not giving up and she will take test agin and the stelent will grow agin in the @DATE1.	1	1		1																					
3171	4	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant.	0	0		0																					
3173	4	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about fating, and she said, �Let�s plant, right now�, she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus in something positive, In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focus Saeng is to passing her driving test.    "	1	1		1																					
3176	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant. 	1	1		1																					
3177	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
3178	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes �saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain.	2	2		2																					
3180	4	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it�s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she�ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus �comes back to life��. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she�ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she�s stating once everything �come back to life� then she�ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.	2	3		3																					
3181	4	There are many reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph . One reason is she likes hibiscus flower you can tell by when she again � When she got to the hibiscus , She  reached out and touch a petal gently .� Another reason is that they are pretty . You can tell by when she says  � It was like walking into another world  .�  Last reason is that she likes the present of them . You can tell by when she say � Huge flat leaves , delicate  wisps do tenant�s  , ferns , and fronds and virus of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.  As you can see these are reasons why the author ended with that paragraph .	0	0		0																					
3191	4	The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng �comfort in her time of discomfort.� She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she�ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
3196	4	In the story, �winter hibiscus�, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for.	1	1		1																					
3197	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become� almost familiar now� that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2		3																					
3199	4	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not work and she is trying again this @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she succeds in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3202	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1 sentence is �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1																					
3203	4	In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she�s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says �I � I failed the test� this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn�t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying� When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she�s determined to strive under difficult conditions.	2	2		2																					
3205	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
3207	4	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.	0	0		0																					
3208	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1		1																					
3210	4	In the story,  @ORGANIZATION1, by  Minfong   Ho, a  girl  named  Saeng  tries  to  adjust  to  a  new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driver�s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the �Winter Hibiscus.�It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn�t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme. This particular  theme  is,  �No matter  how hard something  might  be, you can get through it. You  just  have  to  find  a way that benefits you most.�	2	2		2																					
3211	4	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done	1	1		1																					
3213	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, �When they come back�then I will take that test again.� She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  	2	2		2																					
3215	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example �And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.� She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others	1	2		2																					
3217	4	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard.	1	1		1																					
3219	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3220	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng�s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver�s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.    	3	3		3																					
3223	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	1		1																					
3224	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
3225	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng�s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1		2																					
3227	4	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.	2	3		3																					
3229	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. �Not like the kind we had before �(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.	1	1		1																					
3231	4	The �Winter Hibiscus� is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. �Winter Hibiscus� ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.  	2	3		3																					
3232	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that�s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																					
3234	4	"The author concluded the story with the sentence, because the author wanted to show that since Saeng found the flower she has new hope and reason for passing the test. The flower gave her inspiration because it made her look back on her home in Vietnam �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at"" She found that she was still too shakey to say the words at home""When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden it was like bringing a little piece of Vietnam home which made her feel better. The over all inspiration and the memories the flower had for Saeng made her feel better about her new home and feel better about her new home and gave her a reson to start fresh with her driving test."	2	2		2																					
3235	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.	0	0		0																					
3236	4	The author of �winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.�Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3239	4	The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I know one thing the part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically it is concluding the whole  story, plus the characters	0	0		0																					
3242	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph	1	1		1																					
3243	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it�s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
3247	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 the author wants to show Saeng hasn�t given up. Easly in the story Saeng goes to the green house and starts to cry. When she gets home she says to her mother, �I-I failed the test.� @CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3248	4	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn�t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.	2	1		2																					
3249	4	The author include the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her home land and it will help her. For example Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland.	1	1		1																					
3250	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time	1	1		1																					
3252	4	The story is about he failing the test. She says she will try next year when the geese come back.	1	1		1																					
3255	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� includes �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is� But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much perferred it to a Big Mac.� This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.	2	2		2																					
3259	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																					
3261	4	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story �I failed the test,� and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.	1	1		1																					
3263	4	Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. �when the snow melts and the geese return� This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things.	2	2		2																					
3264	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she�s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She�s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
3265	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.	1	1		1																					
3267	4	She can�t wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts so it isn�t very cold out so they grow and she is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back.	1	1		1																					
3268	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. �Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.� Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story �winter hibiscus� means.	3	2		3																					
3273	4	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring. 	1	1		1																					
3274	4	I believe that the author  concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about it just exploins what happened in the end as if what happeed through the story was the growth and living of a flower.	0	0		0																					
3276	4	The author concludes the story by showing the girl�s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the �Winter hibiscus� is her connection to her homeland. She said she�ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers.	2	2		2																					
3282	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn�t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� When she says �the test� she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, �When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.	2	2		2																					
3283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver�s test. �She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. �This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she�ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3284	4	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaing to the reader�s that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better she will retake the test. That is why the authour used that paragraph to conclude her story.	1	1		1																					
3285	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."	1	2		2																					
3288	4	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year."	1	2		2																					
3289	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story @CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. As well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season	1	1		1																					
3291	4	The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were budding up and that is why I think the author used that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
3292	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says �When they come back� she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. �In the spring� shows when the flower will come back. �When the snows melt and the geese return� she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). �And this Hibiscus is budding� She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. � Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
3293	4	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.	1	0		1																					
3294	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, �She lifted her head.� This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, �when the snow melts and the geese return,� this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, �and this hibiscus budding� she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it�s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																					
3295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.	0	0		0																					
3298	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
3301	4	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard, Some other examples of working hard are the �winter hibiscus."" Another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way."	1	1		1																					
3304	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng can�t give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that she�ll be okay there as well.	2	2		2																					
3305	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her�. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3308	4	The short story �Winter Hibiscus� as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng�s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3309	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn�t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn�t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																					
3311	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see�s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.	2	2		2																					
3312	4	The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive.	0	0		0																					
3313	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus. It reminder her of her old home. Saeng goes to the green house or flowershop and buys one. When she returns she plants the hibiscus. The hibiscus is keeping her from giving up. When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will take the test again.	2	1		2																					
3318	4	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.	0	0		0																					
3319	4	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn�t have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test.	2	1		2																					
3320	4	I  think  when  she  take  the  test  over  it  is going  to  be  in  the  spring  and  She  is  going  to  try  and  pass  it .  But  she  did  not  want  to  cry  in  front of her  mother  . I  think  she  is   going  to  make  it  up  to  her  and  pass  the  test.	1	1		1																					
3322	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3323	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, �when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
3324	4	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story �Winter Hibiscus�.  "	1	2		2																					
3326	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
3329	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she�ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																					
3330	4	He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.	0	0		0																					
3331	4	"In the end of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator describes her desire to take and this time pass the driver's test she failed earlier in the day, she ""vowed silently to herself"" that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future. Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. She is also not enjoying @LOCATION2, because she has already experienced failure at her new home. However, the end of the story provides contrast do this, for Saeng vows to succeed in the future.       "	2	3		3																					
3334	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
3335	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.	3	3		3																					
3336	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.	0	0		0																					
3339	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.	1	1		1																					
3340	4	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new thing again.	0	0		0																					
3341	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn�t bloom and Saeng fails her driver�s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.   	2	2		2																					
3345	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summers, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	3	3		3																					
3346	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																					
3347	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Now tell that wasn�t beautiful.	0	0		0																					
3349	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																					
3351	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																					
3352	4	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.	2	1		2																					
3353	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don�t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																					
3354	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																					
3355	4	Minfong Ho, the author of �  Winter Hibiscus � concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph   to signify Saeng�s   willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the   Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it�s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud  and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng   getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding   better memories while growing stronger. When she gets  the chance. The birds flying  overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring they will return to start over raise goslings, rebuild their home, start over from last spring. Saeng is planning to start over, and pass it so she can drive and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong   Ho, chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify the character�s starting over and rebuilding good memories.	3	3		3																					
3356	4	The last paragraph in, ��Winter Hibiscus,�� was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    	2	1		2																					
3358	4	It means that she want to do it all over again. It the girl comfort zone - So that is what she does when she upset. That is what the story and the phase mean.	0	0		0																					
3359	4	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said"	1	1		1																					
3360	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So in my opinion the author wants to show the readers that the character in story cares a lot about the natures baety.	1	1		1																					
3361	4	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again� because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it�s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing�s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let�s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well	2	1		2																					
3363	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																					
3364	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3366	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, �when they come back... I will take that test again�. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her �winter� is her test and that when she is ready, she�ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she�ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng�s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																					
3367	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
3368	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 because she really cared the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again. Hibiscus is everything far her. it is her good luck. And with hibiscus budding she can make her new life. withaut the hibiscus plant she was laser �I-I failed the test� and �I baught it,� saeng answered reading her mother�s next questian.� She was so depressed with her test failing that why she baught hibiscus to influence her life. she decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding she will start her new life by giving the test again and providing her self how important hibiscus	1	2		2																					
3369	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng�s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1		1																					
3370	4	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can�t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test	1	1		1																					
3372	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says �in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again�.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0		0																					
3373	4	" The author used the paragraph telling about how saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because,the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the u.s. When Saeng says,�and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again� she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things."	2	2		2																					
3374	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng�s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																					
3377	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn�t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.	2	2		2																					
3379	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. �Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won�t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																					
3382	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she�s gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
3388	4	The author  says this because she will try to start her own garden. Her other garden didn�t turn out to well. In the book it says she needed her moms help. 	0	0		0																					
3391	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	""The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng�s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver�s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.� Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."	3	2		3																					
3396	4	The author of this story concluding this story this way because instead opsorbing all the pain she can look in to the future. Aso by looking in to the future she can forget about the past and try better in the future.	1	1		1																					
3397	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said �a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,� I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng�s wasn�t. �Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad.	2	2		2																					
3399	4	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.	0	0		0																					
3402	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.�    "	2	3		3																					
3404	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.	1	1		1																					
3405	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
3406	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  	2	1		2																					
3407	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1		1																					
3409	4	The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.	2	1		2																					
3414	4	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn�t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. 	2	3		3																					
3415	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn�t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3416	4	Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.	1	1		1																					
3418	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng�s Hibiscus� first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																					
3419	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, �Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world� (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her �(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center � just as she had known it would feel� (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.	2	3		3																					
3420	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring when the snows gone she will take the test again.	1	0		1																					
3421	4	In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to.	1	1		1																					
3423	4	There are many reasons the author says �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .� @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  �That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the �hibiscus is budding� means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life. 	2	2		2																					
3425	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus� provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng�s determination.	2	2		2																					
3429	4	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she�s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I�ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I�m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.   	0	0		0																					
3430	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng�s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																					
3431	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1 strength and encouragement. When she�s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She�s saying by next spring she�ll take her test. By next spring she�ll be able to drive. By next spring she�ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don�t always get it right away so keep trying.	2	2		2																					
3433	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, �A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and�yes�familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.� Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																					
3435	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3		3																					
3437	4	The author is letting us /reader know that the give plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is  all gone, when the geese come back and when etcs  warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! the author @MONTH1 also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little give chose and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring!	0	0		0																					
3440	4	The author concluded the story in such a way that the reader�s eyes are opened. It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there�s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.	1	1		1																					
3441	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting.	0	0		0																					
3446	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver�s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (��and this hibiscus is budding��), the author depicts Saeng�s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver�s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng�s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng�s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (��when the snow melts and the geese return��). This shows Saeng�s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.	3	3		3																					
3448	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.� That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																					
3453	4	The author concludes with this paragraph te emphasize the new beginning that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver�s test. &the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. she needed a new beginning to start over in a new country &the flower, the flower the snow , the geese, & the test all symbolize new beginnings &challenges to overcome , the geese & snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus  represent new life,& the passing of the test represent a milestone in saeng�s life . Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader expect something new & exciting to happen to saeng.	3	2		3																					
3454	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn�t done gardening, that she�ll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn�t done. she�d rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3456	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.	2	1		2																					
3457	4	The author concluded this story for a internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus, and the will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration. 	2	2		2																					
3458	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. 	3	3		3																					
3459	4	The resoned the author concludes the story with this paragraph because I she fail the test and make your learned to apprecite nature a litter bitter.	1	1		1																					
3465	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																					
3466	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� in the spring come back the new hopes ,comfort belive, As  she said in the story �in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again.� She hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for. Here the hibiscus mean  hope. Second of all when she said �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding � she  means that is comfort for her it strong than hope and more if her mom helps her blue in her  self because is not easy to do it without her mom comfort. Lastly she said�Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to saeng  now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of a strange before had became, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She mean that the season is coming and the hibiscus  grow she will regain the blive  and the strength that she need to have to take the test the hibiscus means a lot to her means vew  hopes ,comfort, and belive.	2	3		3																					
3468	4	The story of �Winter Hibiscus� is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng�s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.� I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.	3	3		3																					
3469	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter�s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn�t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																					
3471	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.	0	0		0																					
3474	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize�s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																					
3476	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don�t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1		1																					
3478	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn�t want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3479	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
3480	4	The last paragraph of the story was: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic.	2	2		2																					
3481	4	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She she what to make up for it. By helping out in the graden. Her mother usher in and started to make dinner.	1	1		1																					
3483	4	The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on.	0	0		0																					
3485	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a??? Shows she hasn�t given up she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won�t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story. Lastly, I think it gives a feeling for the whole story.	2	2		2																					
3486	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph so the reader has something to think about.When the author concludes with something like that he/she wants the reader to make there own ending or pridicshon. And some times it means a sequel.	1	1		1																					
3487	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn�t give up and is taking the test again. Also she doesn�t want to disappoint her mom she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance.	1	1		1																					
3489	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																					
3491	4	I think the author concludes this story like this because they was beautiful `@CAPS1 gave her good luck because the @NUM1 time around she didnt kno they was their	1	1		1																					
3492	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say �when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says �I will take the test again.�"	0	0		0																					
3493	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn�t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3496	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination.

Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real definition of ""family"". He is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."	2	3		3																					
3503	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" he/she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses."" In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

3504	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being so fortunate to have his parents and his heritage of being Cuban. From paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 was so happy and lucky to have his parents as parents which is the main mood of the memoir.Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. @CAPS1 makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family. @CAPS1 also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well. @CAPS1 is happy to have a great family.

3505	5	"The author generally stayed in one mood. The mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to @LOCATION1 to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their culture. Also the author was saying that even in @LOCATION1 it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas, of the kitchen."" Also the author say's that a home is where geat memeries are and were you grow up, you should never forget it."	3	3		3																					
3512	5	"The author of this memoir created a mood about family. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved,"" this quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize how hard their pareents work to give their children a better life and education. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"","" this also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family then what it @MONTH1 seem. That family gives one life and teaches love. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" this quote tells that home is not just a place where one @MONTH1 live, but that it is about relationships that are created there. These were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
3513	5	"The mood created by this author is clearly greatfull. The author shows how he (narciso) could never stop saying thank you. He honestly loved the feeling his mom and dad made him have, and all thengs they did for him. By what the parents did by moving into a place to call home for Narciso made his mood forever endlessly greatful. By Narciso's mood being greatful I mean endlessly thankful for all that he has thanks to his parents. In this short autobiography, Narciso creats the reader to feel, and know he is happy with the life he has. As this short story creats the mood of being greatful. You understand how he feels as you read many times through out this article, ""I will always be greatfull to my parents..."""	1	2		2																					
3516	5	"The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. From the very beginning, the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space. The author's ""parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen"" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less is a building.     To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality: ""My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family"" (@NUM2). Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented."	2	2		2																					
3517	5	Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author it's a great mood unexplainable. in this article talks about a young man named @PERSON1 and how his life was from then and now. for example, on paragraph @NUM1, says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices. and how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Also, how Cuban music was so passionate, adored so much, and how his parents turned a simple house into a home. therefore, this is the mood created by the author.	2	2		2																					
3520	5	@PERSON1's mood was happy and greatful. @PERSON1 was grateful was because he had his family together and his mom and dad were open house with the culture. He was happy because his life was better thae it would have been if they stayed in Cuba. That was @PERSON1's mood.	1	1		1																					
3521	5	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation.	3	2		3																					
3523	5	The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story.	2	2		2																					
3524	5	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."""	3	2		3																					
3525	5	"The mood created by the author in the menoir. The author was grateful that the chance to growing up in the @LOCATION1. The title named is Narciso Rodriguez. He talks about his life, that he came from cuba. and that his parent welcomes people that come from cuba. They come ""together in a great solidarity and friendship."" I think his mood is every happy. To see that his parent made something out of notthing. The author parent show him with their life, and his teaching have been the basis of his life. I feel the same way because my parent brought me here for a better life. I think you learn everything from your parent How to act and all that. So yea the last sentence he said I liked it. He said I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
3527	5	"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful."	3	2		3																					
3528	5	The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him.	2	2		2																					
3529	5	"In this memoir, there are moods created by the author in the memoir. One mood in the memoir was peaceful. In this excerpt it stated, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great soliderity and friendship."" This meant that everyone got along with no fighting unlike segregation dowin  the @CAPS1 at the time. Another mood is humble. A quote from the text says, ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that no matter what @CAPS3 will @CAPS2 his parents. Lastly, the author created the mood modesty. To prove this @CAPS3 stated, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS3 means that his parents (they) had Showed him everything @CAPS3 knows today. Therefore, this memoir has moods that are created by the author."	3	3		3																					
3531	5	The mood in this story was security and happiness. Security was prevailed when all different people with different culture and heritage could live together without fights or arguments at a time when there was a lot of racial tension in @LOCATION1. Happiness was showed in many different ways. One way was when he was describing the warmth, music and cooking in his house. Also, when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him. Overall, @PERSON1 was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it.	2	3		3																					
3533	5	"The @CAPS2 had many mood in the memoir. The mood that @CAPS1 mostly had was happy and greatfull for having his family and friends near him. @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 didnt have his granparents with him @CAPS1 said ""I would not know my real grand parents Narciso the Elder and consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba."" @CAPS1 was happy that his parents that his parents left everything for him to have a better life. The @CAPS2 is a strong person and had a lot of good and bad moods in The memoir. "	2	2		2																					
3536	5	The mood the author creates in this memoir is a feeling of relationships and love between so called 'extended family'. The author emphasizes the relationship between Narciso Rodriguez's family and the surrounding neihbors is so close that they could be family. The author incorporates the feeling of overall joy and happiness this boy has, even though they have a small house, they could still turn it into a loving home. The author shows how much this boy loves the heritage he has and his fun parents who taught him to love cooking and cuban music. This memoir shows how he is poor, but still can have a fun and interesting life with lots of friends and fond memories. Narciso is very thankful for his parents and this shows how appreciative he is of the simplist things iand home. The overall mood in this memoir would have to be thankfulness. The characters are so thankfull for everything they have.	2	3		3																					
3537	5	"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's ""eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 admires ""their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @PERSON1 feels that ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @PERSON1 ""learned the real definition of 'family.'"" @PERSON1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	3	3		3																					
3538	5	"The mood created in the memoir is grateful. ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad."	3	3		3																					
3539	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author's mood was happiness. He explains that he is greatful for his parents for her home, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author also shows that she was taught how to do things by her parents, and that she was happy that they did that. He thinks that family and friends are important too. For these reasons, the author created the mood of happiness in his memoir."	2	1		2																					
3541	5	"The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. ""They came selflessly� to give their children a better life� I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word."	3	3		3																					
3542	5	The mood  displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home. It showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together. It really showed what he called home and what he called a family. The memoir explained the food he ate and the music he heared all through out his childhood and how he grew up.	2	2		2																					
3543	5	The mood created by the author was happiness. Because every one came together as a family and they look out for each other when they were in need. They also helped each other out and were kind and friendly.	1	1		1																					
3554	5	The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family.	2	2		2																					
3558	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood was well shown in a few ways. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not."" This here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals."	2	3		3																					
3559	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidority."" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says. ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being blood related."" This is now the mood created by the author was ""solidarity""."	3	2		3																					
3560	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, these are some examples about the mood in the memoir. First you should always be happy no matter what culture your in. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" located in paragraph @NUM1. It doesnt matter what culture you are in. Second, be happy from where you come from. ""I was born into this simple house, situated, in a two-family, blond-brick, building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" located in paragraph @NUM2. You should be happy from what town you are from. Lastly, never forget who really matters. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" located in paragraph @NUM3. You should always be thankful to you parents. In conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3563	5	"the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his ""house"" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban ""home"". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."	2	4		3																					
3566	5	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness.	3	3		3																					
3567	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.""The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing."	3	2		3																					
3568	5	I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover.	2	2		2																					
3570	5	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside.	2	1		2																					
3571	5	The move the author created in the memoir was that he made it so theres still hope. Even if your an immigrant you can still make it to the top. @PERSON1 family moved from Cuba when racism was legal. The neighborhood was a family, or unity. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer. Coming from Cuba with nothing starting a new life entirely over was very hard	0	2		1																					
3573	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2	1		2																					
3574	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends."	2	2		2																					
3576	5	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""�our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
3579	5	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	1	2		2																					
3580	5	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did They are happy of ther home and the @CAPS1 is happy because of his amazing educational options. That is what I would say the mood of this story is.	1	1		1																					
3581	5	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important.	2	3		3																					
3582	5	"The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. Narciso was very very greatful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very greatful to his overall parents, for giving up there own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more oppertunities than they had. He is also greatful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love."	2	3		3																					
3584	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."	2	2		2																					
3585	5	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be I believe love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal @CAPS1"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity. The family are imigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country Just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. Now their facing cultural hardships over Just one desition."	1	2		2																					
3586	5	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentioen that the kitchen was the heart of the home and the Cuban music was playing all the time. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting. He also mentions there was rarely a time when was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family.	3	2		2																					
3587	5	"The mood in the memoir is very adventorous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved.

3591	5	"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir."	2	1		2																					
3593	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.	3	2		3

He writes ""could afford to into a modest three room apartment..."" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood."	3	2		3																					
3606	5	"The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""

3607	5	In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodr�guez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.	2	3		3

While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."	3	2		3																					
3613	5	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart � felt. The @CAPS1 � @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did.	1	3		2																					
3615	5	"The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also sad. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. So there was several moods in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
3616	5	"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. @CAPS1's eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 speakes admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 is so thankful they did. @CAPS1 also speakes lovingly of his ""extended family"" and describes his neighborhood. ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This loving, supporting ""family"" made Narciso who is is today and made him appreciate the fact that ""' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" But instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you."	2	3		3																					
3617	5	Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're.  Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like. 	1	0		1																					
3618	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez created a mood of gratefullness toward his mother and father. Numerous times, he wanted to thank his mother and father. For example, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @PERSON1 is so grateful for his parents because they left Cuba to start a new life in @LOCATION1. They sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind. In the text, it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" His parents sacrificed so much just to give rodriguez a better life and thats why he creates the mood of gratefullness in his memoir."	3	2		3																					
3619	5	"The mood of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him."	3	3		3																					
3622	5	The mood of this exerpt is happy. it's @CAPS1 many things he could be happy for. the fact that his parents as childrens didnt live to great and allowing their children to is great. and also the home bringing the family closer together.	1	2		2																					
3624	5	"The autor created a good mood in the memoir because, when you think about how sticked those people were, you have a warm feeling inside.The parents left their country and came in another without any knowledge of her language and her culture, they had to start over their lives with the job they could find because they wanted a good life for their child. They handed a hand to people who were in need, considered all their neighbors as family and they taught their children the real definition of ""family"""	2	1		2																					
3625	5	The mood in this story by Narciso Rodriguez was that in his house he shared many memories in his house. He also shared his feelings. His family would let People in their house that were friends or family.	1	1		1																					
3628	5	In this memoir, the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and food. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure.	2	2		2																					
3629	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is depressing. I think that because it talks about his parents getting immigrated and then the end is sort of happy, because his parents turned it into a home.	1	1		1																					
3631	5	In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to @LOCATION1. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life.	3	2		3																					
3634	5	He gives a mood of friendliness and happy memories. He tries to make the reader feel the happy feelings he felt, so that people would understand how he feels and tried to relate to it. Childhood memories are supposed to give those feelings to the reader.	1	1		1																					
3635	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and greatful. He wants to be able to show his readers that he is greatful for how his parents raised him and what type of enviornment it was. By reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house, surrounded by his friends and family. Narciso Rodriguez is also trying to show happyness, how he was happy with his life and always having friends around him.	2	1		2																					
3636	5	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir."	1	2		2																					
3639	5	"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community."	3	3		3																					
3640	5	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.	2	2		2																					
3642	5	"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	2	2		2

I know this because ""I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home""."	3	2		3																					
3647	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memior is. ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."	2	2		2																					
3649	5	In the passage It shows a child growing up in a lace that he/she thinks Is heaven on earth. The author is trying to show you when you read this and feel a sense of him/she being love did and loving where he/she is. The mood it is creating is happiness also.	1	1		1																					
3656	5	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended it just made me think he was comfortable with his home."	2	2		2																					
3660	5	"The mood in exerpt is in between grateful and caring and hard because thats what @PERSON1's mood ended they way it created was by the type of house he living with them and and also the people @PERSON1 about. Also another mood is comfortable for example when he said ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house explains his mood towards everything. "	1	1		1																					
3661	5	"The mood created by the author is a feeling of greatfulness for his parents.Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with courage. @CAPS2 realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives. His parents had no knowledge of the @CAPS1 language. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, and had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a sense of greatfulness for his parents."	4	4		3																					
3663	5	"The mood in the memoir is gratefullness, happyness and remembrance.                                                                  Narciso is pround and thankfull of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They came to @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life."" They struggled, taking any job that they could find, They struggled for him, so he didn't have to struggle. Narcisco admires them for ""their strength and perseverance."" Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him.                      He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.                                                                                                       Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents."	2	3		3																					
3664	5	The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were. Overall, the whole writing is in a calm mood.	1	1		1																					
3666	5	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could."	3	2		3																					
3668	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family"". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were."	2	2		2																					
3669	5	The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. They now have a bigger house. They are grateful they live in the United States.	1	1		1																					
3670	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1 a mood is created throughout the story. Mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature. In this particular piece the mood was proud and festive. @PERSON1 creates this mood by using various words and phrases. First @PERSON1 said, ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home"" This shows his family's pride because thier house looks like it did in Cuba. Also, the theme was festive because @PERSON1 describes the large parties and dinners that were constant at his home. Third, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a festive mood when he wrote, ""My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate thier arrival to this country"" This quote creates a festive theme because his family all enjoyed partying with others. In conclusion the memoir ""@PERSON2"" there was a theme of festivity and pride through out this whole piece of literature."	3	3		3																					
3671	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one @LOCATION1 mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, the were still happy with what they had. That is what I think the mood created by the author was."	2	2		2																					
3676	5	the @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship. which is great to have.	1	1		1																					
3678	5	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."	3	3		3																					
3679	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why."	2	2		2																					
3681	5	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
3686	5	"The moods created by the author in the @CAPS2 were grate ful because of all the things that the parents did for their child. Friendly because they have ""family"" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their ""family"". Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job. The last @CAPS1 that this @CAPS2 had was from paragraph seven, happiness, the chid has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, Still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states."	2	3		3																					
3692	5	The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors.	2	2		2																					
3693	5	I described the mood create by the author in the memoir and they work really hard to create the mood.	0	0		0																					
3696	5	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	2	3		3																					
3699	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is together the family is organized. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"" the parents really are together thing how to organized the family. That is the mood that is created by the author in the memoir."	1	2		1																					
3701	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!"	2	2		2																					
3702	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3703	5	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring."	2	2		2																					
3704	5	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."	4	2		3																					
3707	5	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family	1	2		2

3711	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
3714	5	The mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling. He talked about his family life and that his parents had to give up everything they had in cuba to come here and start over again. He makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dinning room to eat.	1	2		2																					
3719	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
3720	5	"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."	3	3		3

In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen"" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. Narciso Rodriguez talks about ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays"" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm."	3	3		3																					
3723	5	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."	3	2		3

This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life.	1	1		1																					
3730	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2		2

The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were."	3	3		3

It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive.""

For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation.

3744	5	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1.

From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents.

I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

3777	5	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.	3	3		3																					
3778	5	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen.

3781	5	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life.	2	3		3																					
3783	5	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.	3	2		3																					
3784	5	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	2	3		3																					
3785	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2		2																					
3787	5	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the cooking and music and everything. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it.	3	2		3

3789	5	"The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is saying that @CAPS2 is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family."" @CAPS2 knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. @CAPS2 also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home with love."	2	2		2																					
3791	5	"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."	2	2		2																					
3793	5	The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.	2	2		2																					
3794	5	The mood in this memoir is happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was greatful for mostley everything in his life. In Narciso's neighborhood in the @CAPS1 Came together in great solidarity and friendship. All though they had were diffrent cultures.	1	1		1																					
3796	5	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.	2	2		2

3799	5	The author of this memoir put a mood to it. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling for because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need. I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality.	2	2		2																					
3801	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																					
3802	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is great @CAPS1. Narciso loved to cook. ""A love of cooking that is still with me today."" Narciso loved his parents very much. ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" The Rodriguez family help people come into ther house hold. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3803	5	In this memoir, Narciso talks about how it was hard to be raised by immagrant parents in @LOCATION1, getting cruddy jobs for low pay, but his home is his home, where all of his memories are. In my opinion, his mood is happy, and joyful, based on how much he talks about his home.	2	1		2																					
3807	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home."	2	2		2																					
3809	5	The mood was a little sad at certian times and greatful at others. It was sade that they have to leave Cuba and start all over agin. It was greatful becase they hade family that loved them and cared for them.	1	1		1																					
3810	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was grateful because he wasn't asked to be born in america, hes parents immigranted to america so that Narciso can live a better life. Narciso was happy because he get to see both of his parents, his grandparents which lives in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Narciso was thankful because he gets a home where he can sleep at, a family who loves him, and he could've ask for nothing better than the life he has now.	1	1		1																					
3812	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragrap @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice.	1	1		1																					
3821	5	This memoir creates a warm feeling of nostalgia for the auther's home. The author writes about how his parents were able to make a great home out of a @NUM1 room apartment. The auther also wrote about how his parents raised him wild teaching his cuban heratige	1	1		1																					
3822	5	"Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sound, shites, and smells of his home. ""...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, I would love to be there."	2	2		2																					
3823	5	There where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods where grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was very lucky to move from cuba to the @LOCATION1 and find a better home. They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other. An example that shows how loving they are is when it @CAPS1 they left their family, friends, and careers so their children could have a better life. The last mood was happyness. When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where. In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy	3	3		3																					
3824	5	"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how apriciative he was. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off loving and caring mood to the readers."	2	3		3																					
3826	5	"There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the moods are loving ""I learned here how to love."" @CAPS1 mood is caring ""my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family. And @CAPS1 mood was happiness ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"" That is the mood of this memoir."	2	2		2																					
3828	5	"The mood Created by the author brought out a Cuban @CAPS1 of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean ""blood relatives"" it is People who need help and will have that Same felling for @CAPS2 if @CAPS2 needes that same help. The mood @CAPS3 how @CAPS2 have to go threw alot of times where it's hard and @CAPS2 will lament but @CAPS2 have to get through it and it will pay off. your culture is a part of the mood of the story. This @CAPS4's @CAPS5's came from cuba and had a one bedroom apartment raises a kid and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a cubain house hold of food and music and families. The mood elavtes and esksimtes as they spend more time more family better living space better job and most of all better under standing. The mood of the whole story really cenies around family and the true meaning of family. family is your love ones who care and help, love and respect @CAPS2, That's the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
3829	5	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture."" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love."	3	3		3																					
3831	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one. Because it is telling you what his experience in life was, and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is because they liked to cook all the time. Another reason is that they liked to have fun with their son One last reason is because they had a son. Their @CAPS1 name was @PERSON1.	1	1		1																					
3832	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is happy and grateful. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to @LOCATION1 where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful."	2	2		2																					
3836	5	The mood that was created by the author in this memoir is being happy. The author is happy how Where she use to live she left there to move to @LOCATION1, and made it feel just like home instead of looking back and thinking no place could ever take my real home. The author was positive about this memoir.	1	1		1																					
3837	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2		2																					
3843	5	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way.	2	3		3																					
3844	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."	2	3		3																					
3847	5	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	2	3		3																					
3850	5	"In the memoir there is alot of differet moods such as mad, sad, hopefull. I think that over all it is a happy memoir because in the story is says ""and for which I am eternally gratefull"". and also ""Which I adored to this day."" @CAPS1 I think that over all it is a happy mood, because there is alot of evidence to help support it."	1	1		1																					
3851	5	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull	2	2		2																					
3852	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."	3	3		3																					
3854	5	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.	2	2		2																					
3855	5	As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.	3	3		3																					
3856	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2		3																					
3864	5	The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. Also how their home was a great enviroment. always open, cozy, and loving. The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great.	3	3		3																					
3865	5	The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives.	1	1		1																					
3867	5	The mood created by the auther in the memoir is happyness because in the memoir it describes how many memories are in his house, and it is also happyness because he mentioned his family and friends, and how peacful it is Also because he describes that there was a @CAPS1 cuban music that filled the air. He also described were his house is and he loves cooking, and he describes it as a rich culenary cooking that he loves so much.	2	2		2																					
3869	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. He is grateful for that."	2	2		2																					
3870	5	"There are Many ways I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2.One way I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2 is That he is so greatfull for having Parents that care about him and want him to get a good edication.The second way is that @CAPS1 is always happy at his home, he always has some cuban spirit in his house. his perents cook cuban food and have There Family together.The third way is that he Loved his house how his perents Made it so confortible and his perents made so many of his birthdays there, he had a great time at that house ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home""This are some of the ways I explained the @CAPS1 created"	2	2		2																					
3875	5	The mood in the memoir is loving. It is loving because the authors parent's let pretty much anyone in need, come to live in their house. They did this because they knew if they were in need other people would do that for them.	1	1		1																					
3876	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez it shows the story of how a young boys home and parents have changed his life forever. Originally from @LOCATION2's parents immigrated to the United States in 1956. They started off in a small apartment then later getting the money to move into a ""simple house."" ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relation."" @CAPS1 some of the most loving families are not related.     The mood in this memoir is inspiring to the narrator. This allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life."" The narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness.     Overall the memoir ""@PERSON1"" is a story full of love and should be told for generations to come. The main lesson here is don't take your family for granted, the narrator is forever grateful that his parents ""turned this simple house into a home."	2	3		3																					
3877	5	"The @CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being @CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The @CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him."	1	0		1																					
3879	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. for his family and the people @CAPS1 him. Especially his parents who came to @LOCATION1 from cuba. And At first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. Love for his culture that came from cuba with the music and food. And most of all the place he had called home Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him.	2	1		2																					
3880	5	The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you.	3	2		3																					
3881	5	the mood of this is gratful becaause @CAPS1 is gratful of what her parents did to help her have a better life in america. @CAPS1 was gratful of how her parents left their friend and career just so @CAPS1 can have a better life. @CAPS1 is gratful they gave up alot for her	1	2		2																					
3882	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS1. In @CAPS2 @NUM1, he says how his parents left everything they loved to give the author a better life in @LOCATION1. In @CAPS2 @NUM2, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" In @CAPS2 @NUM3, the author says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, the author talks about how his parents @CAPS3 nothing about the country when they came and how the struggled financially when they came. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM2, the author talks about how he could not thank his parents enough for all they have done for him."	2	2		2																					
3886	5	"The mood conveyed in the memoir is love. The author talks about how thankful he is for his parents love and sacrifice. In other words, he loves his parents because of the love they showed him. Also, the author discusses the unity and love between his family and neighbors. Although they weren't blood related, they formed family-like relationships. Furthermore, the author states, ""a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Just the mere smell of his mother's cooking brought love to the entire room. To conclude, the author used many examples to explain to readers the love that was shared in his home."	2	2		2																					
3887	5	In the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selflessness his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another even though they werent the richest family they still stuck together. In paragraph @NUM1 it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting.	2	1		2																					
3888	5	The author mood is happy Narciso's was talk about have a family in just one little apartment bliuding and thank them for all @CAPS1 had and what @CAPS1 got	1	1		1																					
3889	5	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez he created a mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez creates this mood by showing the generosity his parents have towards their son, family and friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love.iI say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better Life for their son. ""The faith that this struggle with lead them and their children to better times dove them to endure these hard times"". In this quote is love. Narciso's parent's new that for him to have a better life they would need to sacrifice thirs. That is why i feel love is a mood protrayed in the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3892	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez The auther makes the mood seem fermiluar and loving. He created a mood very uplifting and loving as if to say your childhood and family is the heart of your home.                                           In paragraph two the author states that he had lived in a home were celibrations, that formed a backdrop to life in his warm home. What the auther means is, family and friends made the home feel enviting and comterable. The author also explans restating from paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This scentence explains that even if there friends and family had no were to go, they were always welcome in their home.    This memoir creats a very loving mood. In the last paragraph the author explains that home is were he learned the real definition of family and love."	3	3		3																					
3894	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3898	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendlyness is given by Narciso Rodriguez neighborhood at his younge age' In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and frienship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to familys of friends who need a push or help to stand on their feet once again. ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone stying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Rodriguez leaes a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. ""I will always be greater to my parents for their love and sacrifize... Admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basic of my life.

They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."	3	3		3																					
3906	5	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is a upbeat & happy mood.

One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

Which means they were kind and selfless.And he says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."	3	1		2																					
3919	5	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is.	2	1		2																					
3922	5	"In the story ""@PERSON1"", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing the aroma of the kitchen.

And thats how it's in Narciso Rodriguez house with his neighborhood that he like to be with	3	2		3																					
3927	5	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had.	2	2		2

3934	5	"@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of.

3992	5	"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience. Along with personal the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example there was always Cuban music playing along with Cuban food and the parents would always host a person in the house is time to get back on their feet. Above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."	2	2		2																					
3999	5	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air...""

4002	5	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2		2

4140	5	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."	2	2		2																					
4142	5	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.	1	1		1																					
4143	5	The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was.	2	3		3																					
4145	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy his family had no money too he was living in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment in New Jersey they were living a heart of which was a kitchen and his parent were both sharing a cooking duties but his parents still remember the traditional way they act in cuba they were in a very poor house it was a refugee place here all refugee live after he thought about going to school and helping his family After he started going to school and he started learning lot's of stuff about love and other stuff and he started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak @CAPS1 then he started learning it and he lived in a house thats where he celebrate his birthday at it was very small it was the size of the kitchen and he said he will always be grateful to his family for doing so great things for him and thats the time he was very young he was very proud and he said he will be always be to his parents for there love and sacrifice he told his parent that he admired them for there strength and courag and perseverance so it was a very sad life for him and his parents	2	1		2																					
4146	5	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good life back at home but gave it all away for their children. That is why the mood of this excerpt is caring.	1	1		1																					
4147	5	The parent oF Narciso are immigrant they live to Cuba, parents created our traditional Cuban home, It's to hard to live the parent to cuba, this is the great Family to support this in this country the immigrant to live one place, but the imigrant have your own culture in this country iF you are cuban you have you own culture.	0	1		1																					
4148	5	"The @CAPS1 of the poem is very warm and loving The warm memories of his home, filled with passionate Cuban music and the love for culinary arts leave the reader with the warmth and love of the house.

Sergio and @CAPS2: and his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is so loving that the @CAPS1 is struck in a strong, final chord of warmth, which leaves the reader satisfied. The @CAPS1 of @PERSON1 is undoubtedly loving"	3	2		3																					
4155	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, but sometimes sad. The author made sure that the mood went along with the words in the story. The words were happy and sometimes sad. The mood in the beginning of story was sad, but then it got happier as the story went on. This was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	1	1		1																					
4156	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is."	1	1		1																					
4157	5	"The mood created by the memoir created by the author @PERSON1 is that he is a clothing designer that is internationally recognized by the world and he offered his definition of ""family"". It is a heart warming story about him and what he calls his one and only ""family""."	1	1		1																					
4158	5	I think the mood created by the author was to show everyone that Narciso is grateful to live where he does. He loves his home, his parents everyone gets along. even know he's an imarant he wants to succedy and get along with everyone.	1	1		1																					
4159	5	"The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir."	2	3		3																					
4160	5	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great but having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be	1	1		1																					
4161	5	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" I thought that was welcoming and  showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in. He would always thank his parents, because they had left cuba so that their children could have a better life. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them."	3	3		3																					
4162	5	The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning.	2	1		2																					
4163	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1		2																					
4164	5	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life."	3	3		3																					
4165	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life of their children. He writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these. The author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. Also this house has been this special to him, by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family."	3	3		3																					
4168	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way.	2	2		2																					
4169	5	The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in @CAPS1 needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great.	2	2		2																					
4172	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3		3																					
4173	5	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""	2	2		2																					
4174	5	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."	2	1		2																					
4178	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. "	2	2		2																					
4181	5	There are many times in the memoir when author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader.	3	2		3																					
4183	5	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him."	2	3		3																					
4189	5	"The @CAPS1 is trying to set a mood. The mood is inviting and how a family can over come difcultys together. ""parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the countrie."" That is showing how open and caring the family is."	1	1		1																					
4191	5	The mood created by the auther was happy, thoughtful, and very polite. Narciso talked about his family and his life! He also was talking about how he loved his family and what he does best like cooking and playing his Cuban music.	1	1		1																					
4192	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull. The author tells us how he loves his cuban culture. They listen to the music, the cook food and it's just very house warming. The author also loves his family. He doesn't argue with them and they enjoy the time they have together. I think the author is joyfull with all the happiness that surrounds him at his house.	1	2		2																					
4193	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family."" Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir."	3	3		3																					
4194	5	The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life. when he (the author) ex plained how greatful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portreyed a simple but very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was.	3	2		3																					
4197	5	The author creates a simple but peacful and happy mood with the way he describes things. in paragraph @NUM1 he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 that makes it feel almost like you are there. also words he used to describe the neiborhood like hardworking, and close knit, help set the mood for the story. It makes you think of your own family.	2	2		2																					
4200	5	"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy, and proud to of grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). The mood created by the author was a great mood."	1	2		2																					
4201	5	The mood is very loving and happy. The way he talks about the neighborhood he grew up in and everyone was so close. Than how he talked about how caring and uselfish His parent were. Just how gratefull he is made the memoir very happy.	1	1		1																					
4204	5	"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was a very soft @CAPS1 because they are all greatfull for what being going on with their lifes like the @CAPS2 said in paragraph @NUM1 ""It was in this simple house tha my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feas (Albeit a frugal Cuban feas) always filled the air with not Just scent an music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learne there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home."	2	2		2																					
4205	5	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful."	2	3		3																					
4206	5	"Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood.Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a living space into place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life."	2	3		2																					
4213	5	The mood in this memoir is very happy. It kind of shows how lucky we are, by showing how greatful they are to be hear in @LOCATION1. The mood is also joyful.	1	1		1																					
4214	5	"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home."" ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."	2	3		3																					
4216	5	I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about he cooking skills and how she was listening to cubin music in pertheisis it said stuff like which I still love today. When she said our house became a home I think that ment that they are happy settled in theres not alot of stress and everyone seems comfortable. She kept say how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family her house and her life. She must be happy with her life here in @LOCATION1	3	2		3																					
4220	5	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love."	3	3		3																					
4221	5	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."	1	2		2																					
4222	5	the mood givin by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy becaus even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1	1	1		1																					
4223	5	The mood that was created @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it wass all about love and care. So in the end they have mad a Home and a @CAPS4 relationship together and with other people. the authors family @CAPS5 in their home people that they considered Family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood.	2	1		2																					
4227	5	"In the storie ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think the author was very greatful & happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was lathing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved how to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family."	1	2		2																					
4228	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is Love. In paragraph @NUM1. It says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that there will always be love and happiness in your home if you just respect your friends and your loved ones. Life would be good."	1	2		2																					
4229	5	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love.	2	2		2

The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."	3	2		3

4242	5	The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood.	2	2		2																					
4243	5	Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through.	2	2		2																					
4244	5	"The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes ""a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept there arms and door open."" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story."	2	3		3																					
4245	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2		2																					
4246	5	"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. "	2	1		2																					
4247	5	c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage. 	2	0		1																					
4250	5	The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes.	2	2		2																					
4251	5	The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful.	2	2		2																					
4252	5	the mood that the author created in the memoir was so sad and happy and they wer were interested are. I think that this memoir is a good one and I liked the tital of it Narciso Rodriguez.	1	0		1																					
4253	5	"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. "	3	3		3																					
4254	5	In this memoir the mood was created Narciso and his family. @PERSON2 family, created the mood by bring all of the family together in thier old home in Cuba and thier new home in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 brought the mood is this memoir by loveing his family and telling them every day that he is thankful of everything that they did for him whan he was just a child to when he is grown up. Also @PERSON2 family took people in whan thay had nowhere to go and they stayed with them until they got back on thier feet.	1	2		2																					
4255	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be describe in many ways. The mood that the author created was confusing. Is confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of the are happyness, proudness, sadness, and other ones. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez life. The mood created by the author can't be describe since there's too many.	1	0		1																					
4256	5	The author creates a @CAPS1 but happy mood and shows @CAPS1 parts and happy parts in the @CAPS2 about a boy whos parents immigrated. his house was what he grew up in and his parents put a Cuban twist to it.	1	1		1																					
4258	5	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author ""admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly."" overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish."	2	2		2

The love and meaning of family.	2	2		2																					
4260	5	In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.	2	2		2																					
4263	5	The mood is a family that tried to move from their home country to start a new life in a new country	1	0		1																					
4264	5	"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"	3	2		3																					
4266	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood."	2	2		2																					
4267	5	"Growing up in this environment in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish."	0	1		1																					
4269	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. They always helped out people in need. The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. He said that was one house hold he would never forget.	2	2		2																					
4271	5	"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."	4	2		3																					
4275	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
4276	5	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2		3																					
4281	5	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship"" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly"" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were."	2	3		3																					
4283	5	The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the @CAPS1 feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his Culture and house and having people over for dinner everynight just felt happy and welcome. When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics.	2	2		2																					
4296	5	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.	1	2		2																					
4299	5	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point This is the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"""	3	3		3

In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."	3	3		3																					
4306	5	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home.In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking hapened in the house. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this hapening with Cuban music playing in the back ground.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life.

Other people it's a new oppertunitie to meet new people a better job, or go to a better @CAPS2 for your education. I understand it is hard to move from cuba to the united States. Thats across the world not a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much. They always have food on the table so at lest they dont starve. It was a step down moving to united States going from a good jobs to poopy. The mood in this story is very loving between the family and all there friends	1	1		1

This brings a very calm mood of how their home brings them together.Another example is in @CAPS1 @NUM3. @CAPS1 @NUM3 states: ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.""

Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family ""'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy."	3	3		3																					
4324	5	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end. Such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason is that his friends and family is all he got. Such as ""...how important family and friends are. Also because he had to move, so he didnt no anybody. Such as ""...Originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."	1	2		2																					
4327	5	"The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family.

Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful.

He calls his home a warm home. He remembers the inocence of childhood, congregation of family, friends, and endless celebrations.

And I think what he's trying to say is you dont need to be blood rellated to be family, just love and care about someone."	2	2		2																					
4334	5	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood. This is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting. I wonder what he's doing now.	3	2		3

The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."	2	2		2																					
4350	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he tells where they live, how there house is, who lives there and the familys names. The mood of the story is happy. They all want to be to gether and be a happy family. They are telling you where the parents are from and when they moved here. There is alot of love in there family. The parents turned a simple house into a home.	2	2		2																					
4351	5	I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times.	2	2		2																					
4355	5	"Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday"". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful."	3	3		3																					
4356	5	"The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
4357	5	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is."	3	3		3																					
4360	5	The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4361	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	2	3		3																					
4363	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is happy because she said growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative. This is saying that she is happy for what she has in her life. She is saying that she has a nice family, friends, and a good home"	1	1		1																					
4364	5	The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't anywhat exciting at all. All it is doing is explaining this child's life. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful.	1	2		2																					
4368	5	"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"	2	3		3																					
4369	5	"In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family."""	3	3		3																					
4373	5	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story.	3	3		3

It makes him amazed that his parents would do that for him to live a great, happy life.The author will never be able to show all of his appretiation towards his parents, for they did a great thing for him.

4382	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they feel more responcible to help support themself more than anyone else dose as growing up From the young to older, and have been living off their own from being away from your families. I think the mood of the auther is that they feel good about themself and happy to have a better life from the past until now and learn more about themself as they're mood becomes happy and joyful about themself for ""having a better life."" "	1	2		2																					
4383	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood.

He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family. That is how the mood is set.	2	2		2																					
4385	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage� I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	4	2		3																					
4386	5	"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created."	3	3		3																					
4387	5	The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is.	1	1		1																					
4388	5	"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, There are various different moods. The main mood is thankful.           In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankfull mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an example of this thankfullness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph @NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him.      In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thank ful mood."	3	3		3																					
4390	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. I think that creates a very calming are caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood."	2	2		2																					
4392	5	"This memoir really sets of mood of love and comfort. It does this when he tells us that his parents immigrated just for him. Than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner. His parents loved him and made a great inviorment for him like he said, they ""made a house a home"""	1	2		2																					
4393	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home."	3	3		3																					
4394	5	Throughout the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates many different moods. As a ready I got a large variaty of moods from the author. Such as sorrow for the family and what they went through, pitty for the children and how they watched their parents struggle for them, yet at the same time they benefited from watching because it made them stronger. Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much just for their kids to have a better times and a promising future is beyond the relm of words. Words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. This is the mood, and moods, that are potraid in this memoir.	0	2		2																					
4396	5	"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meain to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skillsIn one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of greatfullness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story."	2	2		2																					
4397	5	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy."	2	3		3																					
4398	5	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."""	2	3		3																					
4400	5	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated. Narciso also says this in his memoir. also.Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Now that they've immigrated Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home. There are many moods in this memoir."	3	2		3																					
4401	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with ""family"" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1 and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents. That was the mood of the memoir."	2	1		2																					
4402	5	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez, creates in this memoir is a very apreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are.	2	2		2																					
4404	5	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family. Including the importance of one.	2	2		2																					
4405	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I think it's an example of pride because it says ""for which I am eternally grateful."" showing that will always be proud of Cuban food.  Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it."	2	2		2																					
4408	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot family meant alot to the family. they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. it doesnt matter. It's about Love and careness.	2	2		2																					
4409	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the mood created by the author is that he love to cook, his parents taugh him how and her is eternally gratefull for his parents. Second, his mother and father ""had come to @LOCATION1 with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came to give a better life to Narciso @PERSON1, leaving behind their country they loved.""third, he parents had a simple house. They always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.In summary, this are the mood created by the author."	2	3		3																					
4410	5	"Narciso Rodriguez wrote fondly about his memories of growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He creates a mood of bliss through his loving and grateful tone. Narciso describes his neighborhood as ""of honest, hardworking immigrants."" ""Growing up in this environment gave me a sense of family' that had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" A picture of kind, smiling faces is painted by this description of a tightly-knit, ever-willing to hep group of people. Rodriguez tells of his parents' creation of a beautiful home from just a house. ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's words captivate the reader with a scene of relaxed happiness, generosity, and love. He is clearly grateful for his enviable childhood, and cares dearly for his selfless parents. The peice he wrote has a loose bliss, like eating a delicious truffle."	3	2		3																					
4413	5	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a certain mood. The mood created is love. In paragraph @NUM1 the mood is really shown because Narciso talks about how his family cooked with him, listened to music, and family-friends attends celebrations with him. ""family and friends, and endless celebrations."" This quote shows how he was given love by his family and friends through these celebrations. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso fills the reader up with love. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This last quote shows the love given to Narciso. This shows the mood is all about love."	2	2		2																					
4414	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood that the author was happiness. When example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking.  Another example of happiness was that aromas from the kitchen mixed with Cuban music filled the air. The last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love.	2	2		2																					
4416	5	"In the memoir; ""@PERSON1"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood is both happy and sad.

He likes that his family lives close by in 1970 when his family was allowed to in Cuba for @LOCATION1.  He also is very grateful for his parents sacrifice to give @CAPS1 the life he has.

If you are from an honest family and if they're with you in the hard moments.	1	1		1																					
4420	5	The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone. As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir.	2	2		2																					
4421	5	In my opinon I felt like his culture ment a lot to him and I felt that her house and family and friends was all important to him. In the frist paragraph he describes his family, where they lived where they came from, how old was they and it made me think about my culture and family. In the second paragraph it tells what year she was born in and how his house was and I wanted to describe my old house the only house with more memories then I could think of. His neighborhood is a close tight community with honest hard working immigrants. It made me think about how all are community could be if we was hard working. In my opinon her memories made my memories come back.	1	1		1

4473	5	"The aurther talks about home and family which would be a calm, caring, and happy mood.

She said her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still me today.

4475	5	I beleive the mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you. As @CAPS3 continues through the passage It says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. @CAPS3 soon relizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in Life the true meaning of family.	3	3		3

Overall, Rodriguez creates a loving mood of togetherness."	3	3		3																					
4491	5	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir.	2	2		2																					
4492	5	"The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story. First off, the mood starts with being friendly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice. In the middle of the story, the mood is strong and determined. ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters."" This tells the people had to stay strong through hard times. Lastly, the end of the story is greatful. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This tells how the narrator is thankful. All in all, the moods in the story fit together nicely."	3	3		3																					
4493	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness. He/she wasn't sad at all because all his/her memories were happy. His/her memories taught him/her what family was.

Not one of his/her memories he/she talked about showed any sadness for he made a lifetimes of friends. The author showed us a calm and grateful mood for everything that have happened. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author wanted to express a lot of gratitude for what his/her parents have done for him/her. Through his/her parents Narciso Rodriguez have so much happy memories. Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was anything but sad and his/her memories taught him/her family."	2	3		3																					
4497	5	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The mood was also sad because throughout the whole thing he was saying thank-you to his parents for all his oper tunities. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories. He talks about all his family and friends hangin' out and having a great time. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood."	2	2		2																					
4498	5	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about.	2	3		2																					
4500	5	In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect.	3	3		3																					
4504	5	The mood in this memoir is that Narciso is happy and very grateful for his parents sacrafices and willpower to make Narciso's life better and do give him more opportunitys in his life.	1	1		1																					
4505	5	The mood of the @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 and happy because Narciso Rodriguez parents immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The parents lived in a one room apartment for one year and when Narciso Rodriguez was born They moved in a @NUM1 room house. The parants try to make the house as @CAPS3 can be.	0	0		0																					
4508	5	"In the memoir the mood is very loving, @CAPS1, and thankfull. The mood is loving in many different ways. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" Also @CAPS1 is expressed throughout this memoir. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankfull he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."""	3	3		3																					
4509	5	The mood is memorable because he loves remebering everything that he did in his childhood. Also he also put the memories that he really like in parentheses. Also he thanked everybody on what he did in his lifetime. That is why memorable is a memory in his lifetime.	1	1		1																					
4510	5	The mood created by The @CAPS1 in The memoir is soothing and @CAPS2. I explains how @CAPS2 Narciso is at his parents house. The passage also explains how many friends he has. Narciso is grateful of his heritage which help set a good mood.	1	1		1																					
4511	5	In the memoir a @NUM1 year old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. good affored to move to the modest, three-room apartment soon called home. (@CAPS1 @NUM2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. @PERSON1, Sr. was a mood like man he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy. Narciso was greatful because his parents passed a rich culinary skills and a love of cooking to him. He was happy because he could move to an affordable three-room apartment. @PERSON1 is traditional because he would listen to Cuban Music that would fill the air with mixing the aromas of the kitchen (@CAPS1 @NUM3), he would also have a Cuban feast which brought life and the love (@CAPS1 @NUM4). His babysitter was his first friend that lived above him and graced his kitchen with meals. This man's life was very successful because his traits would show about his community.	3	3		3																					
4512	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."	2	3		3																					
4513	5	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood and described it with such detail and passian and that is why the mood is so unique and special.	2	2		2																					
4515	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right of the bat I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a sense of admiration, greatfulness, and connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story."	2	3		3

4518	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories."	3	3		3																					
4522	5	The mood at the beginning was kind of sadd but then Narciso starts to realize the good things in her life like how her mom turned a simple place into a home and she says she's thankful for her cuban heritage and in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is most thankful for her caring and selflessness parents and that she loves them dearly for everything they do not for just her, but for the world.	1	2		2

There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.

This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences.

He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet.

4740	5	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.	2	2		2

When describing the culinary and musical habits in his home as a child, I can feel the happiness that the moment had possessed. Also, I can feel the love between himself and his constantly growing family that surrounds his kitchen table @TIME1. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great mood.

4792	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez there were many moods created such as, upbeat, happy, and exciting. The first mood that the memoir showed was upbeat. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This was very upbeat and welcoming tune to listen to in the kitchen rather than talking or silence. The second mood displayed in this memoir was happiness. ""All of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" This is a happy thought and time when different cultures can come together to have friendship. The last mood that the memoir portrays is excitment. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations.""

""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes.

His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way."	3	2		3																					
4795	5	"The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him."	3	2		3																					
4796	5	"The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parent both move to @LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house untill they moved to New Jersey, were Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban communitie. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. The community was like a big family, ""the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	3	3		3																					
4798	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. He felt @CAPS1 and curious my mother and father Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved they struggled both personally and financially, braving the Harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship.	2	2		2																					
4799	5	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefind. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything @CAPS1 I thought about it. The article gave off a very comfortting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind."	1	1		1																					
4800	5	"The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because They came from cuba and went to @LOCATION1. as the @CAPS1 says ""My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"". Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child. As the @CAPS1 says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This shows that they moved for the kid and not For themselfs."	2	2		2																					
4802	5	In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories. As a child the author's memories were happy and home setting mostly the mood was good throughout the story. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good.	1	1		1																					
4804	5	"The whole memoir gives off a very positive attitude. The author explains a feeling of unity and Friendship. This quote shows this, ""� all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in Friendship."" The author is saying that despite the fact that they were living in times of racism, all different cultures and their neighborhood lived in peace. Paragraph @NUM1 has a feeling of caring. For others and love. The author explains how his mother and Father moved out of Cuba for better lives for generations to come."" ""They came selflessly,� To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their Families, Friends, and careers in the country they loved,"" shows the feelings perfectly. The final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the authors parents. He states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, in the last line of the memoir, the author describes the true mood of his house growing up. The memoir reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."" The author is saying that his house was and just living space, it was full of love, caring, and great relationships. The whole memoir has a loving mood."	3	3		3																					
4808	5	"The mood created by the author is your family will always be there for you, a quote from the story is ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a homeThe mood might also be there are always better opertunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parent's moved to @LOCATION1 for a better opertunity for their kids. ""It was here were I learned the real definition of ""family""."" ""And for this I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love ."" "	2	2		2																					
4810	5	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood.The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.""Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings through his memoir."	3	3		3																					
4815	5	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand he's describing his family's happyness and unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian family's around the area but also segregation in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
4817	5	The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love.	1	2		2																					
4818	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez.	2	1		2																					
4820	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family.	2	2		2																					
4821	5	"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she is happy about her home, her family and the love she has been given in her life. These are the various moods in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4823	5	The mood is the @CAPS1 is happiness, for example at the end he says you can find happiness anywhere and he did. He found it  in a abandoned home. The @CAPS1 sayes that he got All the thing his parents didn't get. That show happiness.	2	1		2																					
4824	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."	2	2		2																					
4826	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 indacates how family and happiness is the best thing, and how A home is were you feel safe and happy, not just for space, but safeness, Narciso made his home a good place for him and his family. He hade a place to call home.	1	1		1																					
4828	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1																					
4830	5	The mood of this memoir is happy. The main character of this story is Narciso he was kinda poor him and his family lived in a on bedroom appartment and he didnt mine because he loved everyone around him especially his parents because they gave him everything and now Narciso Rodriguez is a fashion designer in his hometown Newark, New Jersey	1	1		1

4833	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. What was the mood?     In paragraph @NUM1, the mood was joyful and heart-breaking.

In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. In conclusion, the mood can always help the story flow and work so well."	2	1		2																					
4834	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,"" the mood is portrayed as very cheerful, warm, and happy. The way that the author described his home and early years provided an image of a large happy family throughout the passage. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""  This portrays the image that life in the author's home was friendly and loving. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This means that their family was very close and would always look out for eachother. So in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving."	3	3		3																					
4835	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir shows him that he is grateful to have a home to live in When he was born by his parents.

He has learned the definition of ""family"" and know what a ""family"" is like and he respects his family for having a great home in @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 has learned about how to love, and not forgeting his family for bring this simple house into a home as said in the last paragraph.

4845	5	"The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. He talks about his family and friends throughout the piece, and how much they have changed his life. He talks about Cuba and its culture flowing through the home, how his parents threw their careers away so that their children can have a good life, and how everyone in his neighborhood was very close knit as if they were a family. All these aspects of his life thrown together with words like ""faith"", ""struggle"", ""admiration"" and ""selflessly"", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong heartfelt mood."	2	2		2																					
4847	5	"the mood the author had created in the memoir is happyness for his home.The author says that family doesn't have to be blood related. the author states, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."""	1	1		1																					
4848	5	The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir.	3	2		3																					
4849	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it."	3	3		3																					
4852	5	The mood created by the author is a warm happy mood. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story.	2	1		2																					
4853	5	I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in paragraph @NUM1, in the beggining Narciso's parent gave up there	1	1		1																					
4854	5	The mood the auther was in was @CAPS1 & happy. The reason It was happy & @CAPS1 is because they talked about Being @CAPS3. And living in a @NUM1 @CAPS4 apartment.	0	1		1

Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture of language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in @LOCATION1, and didn't want to leave friends and family, @ORGANIZATION1's mother and father sacrificed it all to give @CAPS1 a better life.

As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening too everyday. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied of what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.

4876	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir the author's mood feel sad. Because in the cuba, @PERSON1, had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering.

He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember.

4885	5	"The mood created by the author of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is generally a happy and memorable one. The author describes how his parents came to @LOCATION1 and had to start all over. However, the author's parents are still very kind and turn their neighborhood into one big family. The parents cook and celebrate things with the neighbors. The author says he is very proud that his parents were such caring people. The mood of this story is overall very happy, sharing, caring, and grateful because of how nice the parents were.

4887	5	The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.	2	1		2																					
4888	5	I think it was proud mood cause she is saing what her parents did for her.	1	1		1																					
4889	5	"The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir.

This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents.

He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents."	3	3		3

Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home.""

4891	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were shown and created in the memoir. One mood shown in the memoir is great love.

In the final paragraph, the author wrote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Many positive emotions were created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir."	2	2		2																					
4896	5	"The mood is obvesoly love, and greatfulness. ""(And for which I am exernally greatful)."" The boy is young so he doesn't quite get how big that move for them was. ""In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely."" This means leaving family, friends, @CAPS1 new jobs, a house to put over his head, and leaving their home to give a great one for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his cuban life alive. They didn't forget where they came from.Now I think about it one of his moods could be sad because he was the reason for all that happend. What happen if he was never born he would ever never found out what family means. That is why in this memoir has some greatfulness, some love, and that little bit of sadness."	2	1		2																					
4902	5	I think @CAPS1 mood in this @CAPS2 was @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 and glad @CAPS3 grew up with such good Parents and How There not self ish	1	1		1																					
4903	5	I think that the mood that the author created was a unpleasnt. One beccause he lived in a one room apartment so that must mean that they are poor. and that they live in a poor town without any food.	0	1		1																					
4904	5	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home countrys. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words. The mood in this memoir gratitude and it is easiest to see in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3.	2	2		2																					
4905	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started of in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is."	1	2		2																					
4906	5	The mood that the author created in the memmoir was very thankful. He was very thankful for his parents coming to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. The opertunties it gave him a better education and to be successful.

Narciso is stating how impressed and generous his parents were and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learn wasn't just taught, but were shown by his parents lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading.	3	3		3																					
4913	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He does this by talking about homes, friendship and his neighborhood.                                                                                                                                  He creates this happy feeling by talking about his home. He talks about his simple house in which was created a cuban home. His kitchen has aromas of food filling the air. The rich skill of cooking was passed on to him. In this house he had the innocence of childhood.                                                                                                                         The second way he creates a happy mood is talking about friendship. He talked about how his land lords daughter was his friend and babysitter. This led to a playful warm tone as he lead to his grandparents who also enjoyed a meal at his house.                                                                                                                                                         The last way is talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other. They all came to @LOCATION1 hardworking and willing. The author also wrote that family doesn't need blood.                                                                                                                                                                        Those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir	3	3		3																					
4915	5	"After reading the selection ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 I have decided the as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good mood to it. One thing that made the mood good with all the talking about parties. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking. Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day."	3	2		3																					
4917	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful. Appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room. But he loved it there was and is good memories. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thank them repedatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.                                                                                                                                                                                           That quote told every thing the whole mood of the story and the very last sentence                                                      ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	3		3

4921	5	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example @PERSON1 would do anything for his family. If @PERSON1 did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them. Second, it is happy. For example @PERSON1 has a baby sitter and his first friend. Lastly, it is loveing. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is very greatful when he talks about his parents and the mood describes that by makeing the home feel loved.	2	2		2																					
4922	5	The mood was him just triing to remember all of his past memory as a @CAPS1 and his home what he could remember was all good things nothing negative about his home what I read was that it was a very good healthy environment had friends and had a good mother everybody wishes there life was like that.	0	1		1																					
4924	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is grateful. The narrarator in this memoir is very grateful as it states in paragraph @NUM1. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. He also says that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do. The narrarator is also very proud of being Cuban. Also, he loves Cuban music. He also states that he loves his house in paragraph @NUM2. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays"". The mood created by the author is grateful in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."	3	3		3																					
4925	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by: Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer. The mood created by the author in memoir is happy. You can tell that the mood is happy because throughout the memoir the author tells about all the good times that they had in their house in Newark, New Jersey. The author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there. He/@CAPS2 also tells about how their was always cuban music and cuban food. They used to have fun at that house. That's how you can tell that the mood is happy."	2	2		2																					
4926	5	In the short story of @PERSON1, there is a very happy mood. The story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice. He says how his parents made their house a home, and how they put a lot of their Cuban heritage into the house. The story says that he was incredibly greatful to have parents that gave him so much love and sacrafice. The mood in the story is deffinetly a very happy one.	2	1		2																					
4927	5	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir.	1	2		1																					
4929	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it patrays the mood of Narciso home and relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
4931	5	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them."	2	3		3

This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home."	0	2		2

4937	5	The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphesized by the hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four. But, the memoir create the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the explinations of the families struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to give up in order to selflessely better their childrens life.Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article.	2	2		2																					
4941	5	In the @CAPS1 by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certin mood, tward his parents, a mood of happyness and greatfullness.Thorought the hole @CAPS1 Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life.

4946	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir.	2	1		2																					
4948	5	"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one.

Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing.

4955	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories) The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of racism in the @CAPS1 his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love."" Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love."	3	3		3

He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away.

This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"".

4965	5	The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family.

5026	5	In the memoir many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness.

In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness.	2	1		2

Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to. The @CAPS1 states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The @CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast."	3	2		3

5045	6	Him from the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some @NUM1 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings were other people worked and lived. If something happened while he dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the worry the owners of the building had about that happening over such a densely populated area.	3	3		3																					
5046	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for."	1	1		1																					
5048	6	The builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final peice that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.	2	3		3																					
5049	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten."	3	3		3																					
5054	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would dirigible's to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and get passengers could safely get on and off The dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. They of the Empire state Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.	2	1		2																					
5059	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.	2	2		2																					
5062	6	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law."	2	3		3																					
5064	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"", by: Marcia Amidon @CAPS2 the builders of the empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building for the entire idea was dropped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles.  "	3	3		3																					
5068	6	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing feilds but using these at the empire state building Where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe	3	3		3																					
5071	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many issues in the attempt."	3	2		3																					
5072	6	The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project.	2	2		2																					
5074	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. some other obstacles builders faced was the safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5075	6	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area.	3	3		3																					
5083	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."	2	3		3																					
5084	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants."	3	3		3																					
5086	6	"Based on excerpt builders of Empire State building faced alot of obsticles. Here are my three points to consider. They need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash in to the building. It was too high firstly. The builders needed to make long difficult, plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, The Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, The mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obsticles. The plans were difficult the Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high."	2	2		2																					
5087	6	"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
5089	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that it would have to of been a very dificult situation and chalenging to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I would have to say would be the wind pressure they had when the thouand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable that must of been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard. Over sixty thousand dollers' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do alot of work that would take a while to get done if it has all over sixty thousand dollers' worth of work they had to do @CAPS1 on the frame work.	1	2		2																					
5090	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation."	3	3		3																					
5091	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true.	2	3		3																					
5092	6	"When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea."	1	1		1																					
5095	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 There is an obsticle that the builders had to over come. Building the top of the empire state building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The designers designed a new tower that was a ""shinny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside"". The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft its self. They also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible. another problem with it was there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get to close to urban places. Over all it was a hard pain saking design for them and costed alot of money."	2	2		2																					
5098	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the morning mass. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose.	3	3		3																					
5100	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized this was not smart. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5102	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed.	1	1		1																					
5103	6	"Builders had many promblems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all in @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author exsplains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the buildings frame"". Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other then helium. Hydrogen is very flamible, and because new york is so populated it would not be safe to podestrions. Seeing this you can tell that builders had to many promblems coming from such an ""easy"" thing."	2	3		3																					
5104	6	"The obstacles on allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were far to great, something that should have been obvious before construction started. One major reason, safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, and after the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, the idea was shot down. Another reason why it just didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State building. Winds would have been to great for dirigibles to safely dock at the Empire State. There was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. With a dirigible approaching the building would make it illegal. Thus ending the idea to proceed."	3	3		3																					
5107	6	"The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
5108	6	"The obstacles that the builders @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles is making its speed go up. Another obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is the landing area. The last obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is making sure that the passengers get on and off safely. Like it says on paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."""	1	1		1																					
5109	6	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the empire state building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles. Well for starters, the winds up that high were over-powering, as it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also there was the dirigibles themselfs that caused a problem For they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flamable, One other problem was air laws they state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low. It is because of these problems that destroyed Al Smith's Idea that building could dock airships."	3	3		3																					
5111	6	Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire @CAPS1 Building Was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself. These impracticalities combined with the use of airplanes rather than blimps gaurenteed no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5112	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.	2	3		3																					
5114	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 with the amount the dirigible @PERSON1 and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up @CAPS1 the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting"" in result the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2 obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings, close by the dirigible could be pierced and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city."	3	3		3																					
5115	6	The builders of the empire state building where faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for.The first problem for the builders came up about the buildings frame. A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame. the load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the buildings foundation, which was much to far below. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects we're presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way befor construction. the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. most dirigible outside the country used hydrogen wich is highly flammable. There already had been an exsplosion one over New York could be to much.	2	3		3																					
5118	6	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be.The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed."	3	3		3																					
5125	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no Landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could @CAPS4 at all. To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to @CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.	2	3		2																					
5126	6	"Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the ""@CAPS1"" of the building, and it might affect the frames or ""@CAPS1"" of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York.

He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"".

5134	6	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."	3	3		3																					
5135	6	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.	3	2		3																					
5136	6	The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5137	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were alot of things that builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigible to dock there"	3	3		3																					
5139	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic.	3	2		3

The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles (which are enormous steel formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter then air). They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the empire state building: A moor added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" As stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. Al Smith was successful when building moore cause it was good for dirigibles."	0	0		0																					
5146	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3		3

Safty was an obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium and because hydrogen is flammible it was not safe at all because it could have caught fire just like the ""Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 so the owners of the Empire state building saw how it was unsafe for the public and the building.

In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling.""

5154	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there is an obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This idea would not work because the dirigibles is way to heavy, and that would cause more pessure towards the Empire state building. When there a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would collapse. ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another obstacle is it was expensive to build it. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York there are many places and people are tightly packed. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York city."" These are the main obstacles of the Empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock."	2	2		2																					
5155	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most aparent problems was its a urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the street. They didnt want to dirigibles flying so close over with out not knowing wha's gunna happen. Another thing was that the German dirigible had been destroyed by fire. They had to think about how worse that could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and completely destroying the building. Also how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold a dirible. There were many problems they didn't think about in the process, that's why the mooring mast wasn't successful as planned.	2	2		2																					
5156	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating.	2	2		2																					
5158	6	Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.	3	3		3																					
5160	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium.

Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal.

The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

People did'nt want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. If people did'nt want to try it then it will become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. Last obstacle would be that it would'nt hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.""

5176	6	During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used.	3	3		3

5179	6	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."	3	3		3																					
5182	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project."	3	3		3

As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.

5186	6	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents.

Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.	2	4		3																					
5203	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it.One major obstacle was safety, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the [@LOCATION2] used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building.In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the air plane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed."	2	3		3																					
5204	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people.	3	2		3																					
5205	6	When building a structer as big as the Empire state building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for It dock. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The building would have to be @CAPS1. All these problems must be taken into consideration. This would mean spending more money	1	1		1																					
5206	6	When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct.	3	4		3																					
5209	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at."	3	3		3																					
5210	6	"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon L�sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the space. An example ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" @CAPS1 saying it was going to be hard finding a place to land. Although that may had been one of their problems that was not the only problem it was the safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken along time just land and fueling. Another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast"	2	2		2																					
5212	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced law against airships flying to low over urban areas This law made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building, fearing That The Wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. That would harm the dirigible's shall Then another dirigible attempted a Publicity stunt, when it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspaper to the Empire state building. The Idea of The mooring was shelved. They yet unsolved Problems of mooring air ships to a fixed Mast at Such a height made it desirable. The highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking Passengers, has never been open to The Public.	2	1		2																					
5213	6	"The builder's main problem with safety. Most Blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving to the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disasterous. Another Obstacle is the winds. According to the exerpt ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" One final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The builders faced many obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5215	6	The builders of the empire State building were faced with many different obstacles. One was the empire State building it @CAPS1. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world so only construction plan that goes wrong could be trajic for all the people below. When the started Construction on the mooring mast they knew there was Some risk but didn't think it threw. See all this was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire state to be the biggest. Now he didnt @CAPS2 look into it if a blimp was to @CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the buildings foundation. Also they would have to worry about the blimp it @CAPS1 back then dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and if Something was to go wrong ever downtown New York and the blimp was to catch a spark it would burn four city blocks	2	2		2																					
5218	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed."	3	3		3																					
5219	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that it was unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the excerpt it says the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building was constantly shifting and the back of the airship would swivel around. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over the urban areas. These are the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had faced."	3	3		3																					
5221	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properply. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930's."	2	2		2																					
5222	6	The obstacles; the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They delt with the frames and shapes, but theres other reasons that are not so physical.One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using the Empire state Building, where the blimps would be dangling high about pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe.Another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law made it illigal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State building itself. The blimps couldnt lad on the flat roof of the Empire state building. The builders of the Empire State Building had alot of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the @CAPS1 of politics and nature aswell.	3	3		3																					
5223	6	In this excerpet from the mooring mast by marcia amidon, there was alot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one oBstacle that the builders faced was the weight and presure of a DiriGiBle @CAPS1 on @CAPS2 one teather at the top of the empire state building. this was a big @CAPS3 because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building sending the preasure all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below. another obstacle that the workers faced was nature its self. this was a @CAPS3 because of the high speed winds at the building shifting all the time. If a DiriGiBle was to be teathered at the top by only one rope in the front the back of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion there were many obsticles builders had to face to attempt this project.	3	2		3																					
5225	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration."	3	3		3																					
5226	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	4		3																					
5227	6	They ran into a few problems when it @CAPS1 to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse.	1	2		2																					
5230	6	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.	1	0		1																					
5233	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.	3	3		3																					
5235	6	In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles.	3	3		3																					
5238	6	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked.	3	3		3																					
5239	6	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building.	3	3		3																					
5240	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety, most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle the builders faced, was nature itself. The wins on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast.A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5242	6	The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first.	1	1		1																					
5244	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
5245	6	The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell.	2	1		2																					
5246	6	Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realize how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the Mooring @CAPS1, becoming dangerous. The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.	3	3		3																					
5247	6	There are many reasons Why the builder's faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State building and can destroy downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the exerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York.	3	2		3																					
5248	6	"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (L�sted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (L�sted)"	4	1		1																					
5250	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face they had to add to more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floor. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor.	1	2		2																					
5253	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock."	3	3		3																					
5254	6	Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind.	2	2		2																					
5256	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast."	3	4		3																					
5260	6	When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5261	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality."	3	3		3																					
5263	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."""	3	3		3																					
5266	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (@CAPS1 1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them @CAPS2 and open their eyes."	1	1		1																					
5269	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used.	2	2		2																					
5270	6	There are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. In conclusion There were too many large obstacles to overcome.	2	2		2																					
5273	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state face was trying to make sure the building don't fall down.	0	0		0																					
5274	6	Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame because the blimps could hanging there. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to make the mast. The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two.	2	2		2																					
5275	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around.	3	3		3																					
5277	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more."	1	1		1																					
5278	6	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building.One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building. Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																					
5279	6	While building the Empire State Building the architects were faced with many obsticles when the decision was made to use the Empire State Building to talk, load, and refule dirigibles.  How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose.	2	2		2																					
5280	6	The first obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lake of suitable landing area. Because some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City.The second was that there dirigibles had hydrogen in it and hydrogen was highly flammable. And the realized how much worst accident could have been if it had taken place in New York because this is where they were located. They had to re-think about they're plan. And another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	2	2		2																					
5283	6	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flamable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law.     As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" @CAPS1 how Flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area.     Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" @CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough.     Finally I said in paragraph @NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""     @CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above."	3	3		3																					
5286	6	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" -paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles."	3	2		3																					
5287	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while building it One obstacle they hit was the dirigibles couldnt dock there because of no mooring mast When the architects and engineers built the building they put a flat roof which the Mooring Mast could not be placed on. They said that the frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix the situation. Another obstacle was they couldnt have a Rope holding the Mooring Mast up because the dirigibles wouldnt hold it up. Those are some obstacles the architechs went threw.	2	1		2																					
5288	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was that the winds at that height were alway changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempt to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""  It just wasn't made do that job so it wouldn't work."	3	2		3																					
5289	6	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were to many to predicte. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climite, Buildings and most of all the dirigibles them selfs.The climite as said in paragraph @NUM1 consisted with dangerouse and uncontraiable winds and the reason was because of the Empire State building itself. The urban areas around consited of sharp hull breaching spires and due to the winds it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely.Finaly there constrousion. Dirigibles were made with steel fram wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to make it lighter unfortuntly the hydrogen with highly flamable.	2	2		2																					
5291	6	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. According to the excerpt the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. Also having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of The building. In order to maintain the dirigible in place it would cost them money. Quoating the article, ""The stress of The The The dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" The technical and financial issues made it difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building"	2	2		2																					
5293	6	"In the the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had to acomidate a lot of thing to allow dirigibles to dock at The mooring mast. For example In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation"". Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These factores and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never poot to use do to the feer of safty and law."	2	3		3																					
5294	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced."	3	3		3																					
5295	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen.First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building. Also @CAPS1 nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast such as in @CAPS1 @NUM1 says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure."	1	2		2																					
5298	6	The obsticles The empire state building were The baloons being made out of flammable material, The wind blowing The dirigible around	1	1		1																					
5300	6	Acording to the @CAPS1 both the @CAPS2 and the architects came across several obsticles when it came too building an Area Where Blimps could land that made this @CAPS3 unfesable. One of the @CAPS4 Reasons that this @CAPS3 @CAPS5 was due to the Air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban Areas. An additional conflict was fact was that @CAPS6 winds could push the tale of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it where a balloon.	2	2		2																					
5304	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
5305	6	Al Smith had a great idea. When he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to full potential. Although there were many problems to this idea. One was the urban area below, many people lived in downtown New York City and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on the top of the building.	2	2		2																					
5306	6	"Some of the things they faced were safety hazards. Like when they said in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when the Hindenburg was destroyed they said ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it was over new york."" Another obstacle they faced as they said in @CAPS1 @NUM2 was ""Nature itself."" The winds would make a airship @CAPS3 around like crazy. The last problem was the law stating airships can @CAPS3 that low above urban cities."	2	2		2																					
5307	6	"In the @DATE1's dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
5313	6	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made."	3	3		3																					
5314	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framewor The greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	2	3		3																					
5315	6	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attemp of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing.Secondly, the decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The authors says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the buildings structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building.In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the State holding."	1	2		2																					
5316	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5317	6	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At @CAPS1 the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over @MONEY1 to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in @CAPS2 this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped.	3	3		3																					
5319	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas."	3	3		3																					
5321	6	Al Smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world tallest building, and he didn't give up. In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building, goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted transportation to involve.The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was the lack of landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.One of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. It was also an existing. law against airships, flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
5322	6	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face."	2	2		2																					
5323	6	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.	2	3		3																					
5327	6	while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them which ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. A lot of money was spent on these new renevations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame. But overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles.	2	2		2																					
5328	6	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of @LOCATION1 would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.	3	2		3																					
5331	6	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibes, for example in the text it talked about if the accident had taken place over @CAPS1 it would of been alot worse because New York is A populated city another obstacle was the height as mention in the text and any thing could happen at that height so those are some obsticles in the way of the docking of the dirigibes.	1	1		1																					
5335	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable.	2	2		2																					
5338	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the was obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. One obsacle was that dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. This was a problem because as it says in paragraph @NUM1, line four, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" The geatest obstacle for builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was nature itself. Nature itself would be an obstacle because ""dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weighths, but using the at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" This were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there."	2	3		3																					
5341	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were one it was very windy so it was hard for the dirigibles to hook up to the gear. Anouther was the dirigibles very flamable so they were a danger to the city if the caught on fire. One other reason was it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area	2	3		3																					
5342	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.	3	2		3																					
5347	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's @CAPS1. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building was always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2, there is a law in the United States against airships Flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State @CAPS3, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job."	3	3		3																					
5348	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (@NUM1) the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents causing the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) @CAPS1 the Hindenburg which blew up, if a Blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, a huge risk to the mooring mast. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally. All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building."	3	3		3																					
5353	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework. The architects changed the design and made something new. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles.	1	1		1																					
5355	6	The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The frist reason would be that flying an airship that low over a urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as, the winds. The one time that they tried they couldn't dock it because the winds are too strong.	2	2		2																					
5356	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.	2	2		2																					
5357	6	Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City	3	3		3																					
5358	6	In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York @CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted.	2	3		3																					
5360	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5362	6	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.	3	3		3																					
5367	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear.	3	2		3																					
5368	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to try to @CAPS1 dirgibles there. One of the challenges they faced was how to make sure the building wouldn't collapse if the docked a @NUM1 foot dirgigible on the top. They had to make about @NUM2 dollars worth of changes to the building's frame to be able to @CAPS1 a @CAPS2. Another obstacle they faced was how to @CAPS1 dirigible at the top of the building without endangering the densiley populated area of down town New York. ""Most dirgibles outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The builder faced many obstacles by trying to beable to @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 but was impossible from the @CAPS3."	2	2		2																					
5370	6	Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the lead could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building.	1	1		1																					
5371	6	"The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area.""The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower. It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe.""Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark, and the idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for it to succeed."	3	3		3																					
5372	6	"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey.The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no @CAPS2 dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens imaginations and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5377	6	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work.	3	3		3																					
5381	6	"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5385	6	"Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the Empire State Building. First, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building ""would add stress to the buildings frame"". -@CAPS1 @NUM1. These Dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like New York City could be very dangerous. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""-@CAPS2 @NUM2. If lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
5386	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstecles in attemping to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours to refuel.	1	1		1																					
5387	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable teather to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame.Another obstacle the builder's faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. this meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved @NUM1 floor by a special elevator. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the dager and impracticalness of docking dirigibles @NUM2 stories over New York City."	2	2		2																					
5388	6	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking.  The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space.  There was also the problem of winds.  The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock.  The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible.If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage.  The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building.  It could end up like the hindenburge.	2	2		2																					
5389	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."	3	2		3																					
5390	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous.I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off!As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""@CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now!"	1	3		1																					
5391	6	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways.	3	3		3																					
5393	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic."	2	3		3																					
5394	6	The problems that the Building had to face the could not unsolve the problem of mooring air ships to fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear.	0	0		0																					
5395	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles.The architects desgned a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to have the wind blowing around up on top. In the late run they would have to face the law. These are the obstacles that the builders had to face.	2	2		2																					
5396	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building were, They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast could not because the way of the height of the building was @CAPS1 high dirigibles would not be able to keep @CAPS2 while unloading. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the goodyear blim columbia, attempted a publicity stunt Where it would it tie up and deliever a bundle of newspapers"", ""Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had Never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp"". other obstacles were, that dirigibles outside the united states had hydrogen in them Instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable."	2	2		2																					
5397	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly over too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared.	2	2		2																					
5398	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station.	3	3		3																					
5399	6	"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth). Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe."	3	3		3																					
5402	6	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable.	2	2		2																					
5403	6	In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. With this idea the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific Ocean. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	1		2																					
5404	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't a easy job. They spended over sixty thousand dollars on just modifications. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work. @CAPS2 you can see they spended a lot of money on the mooring mast.Also it wasn't a easy job to make everything work there was a lot of things they had to worrie about like safety issues. I know it wasn't a easy job because in paragraph @NUM1 it also said ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof."" @CAPS2 you can see they struggled to make the mooring mast accomplish."	1	2		2																					
5406	6	The obsticles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The @CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
5408	6	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigable to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to be accomadate this new situation"" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp"" The building would collapse while taking other buildings down. sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame but in the end, the building still failedAfter the frame was stable enough, more problems ocured. ""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3		3																					
5410	6	"The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire were saefty, nature, and U.S law.

Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. ""The Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4).

5413	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, the workers had to modify the frame or otherwise ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The mooring mast goal was really starting to be dowstable when one problem wasn't realized. Safty, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flamable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights, but using them at the Empire State building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor Safe""."	3	3		3																					
5414	6	The obsticles the @CAPS1 faced In attempting to Allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 is that they needed a @CAPS3 enough cable so It cold @CAPS4 the Blimp, the passengers and any @CAPS5 weight.

This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.

5419	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high. The above explains the obstacles of the Empire State Building for dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
5420	6	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face.	1	2		2																					
5421	6	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction.	0	1		1																					
5422	6	The Empire State Building was and is the tallest building to ever be built. To make it the tallest building Architects had to design the Mooring Mast. In building this mast there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles it was still finished.The Mooring Mast was needed because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world. To make the Mooring Mast work the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast they would have to attach steal from the Mast all the way down to the foundation. Another was After designing the Mast they had to change the original plans for the building.	1	1		1																					
5423	6	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between @CAPS1, saftey, and nature, there was no way this idea could ever work. Although the idea was good it was very impracticle.     Saftey was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands.      Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous.     Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impracticle. It never happened due to saftey and now serves as a tea and soda area for use of sight seers.	3	3		3																					
5424	6	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal.	3	3		3																					
5426	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building"	3	3		3																					
5427	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5428	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5429	6	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.	3	3		3																					
5430	6	There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it. Since these problems all could result in deaths, the idea was thrown out.	3	3		3																					
5433	6	The building had a steel framed body up to @NUM1 floors the glass windows to the 102nd floor. They had to also had to upgrade the building because the stress that gets put on from the blimps.	1	1		1																					
5434	6	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below.	2	2		2																					
5435	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
5439	6	"There are afew obstacles the builders had. to face in this project. One of them was was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect building of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1 � Al Smith) Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up two @NUM2 miles per hour. They were as long a 1 thousand ft. That would take up @NUM3 blocks New York City. They didn't have good landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing. No matter what they need hangin dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
5440	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, this made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5443	6	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were urealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; for in dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas.In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]. ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock. The law on the altitude of airships wouldn't allow dirigibles to even get close to the @ORGANIZATION1. The plans for the Empire State Building were never realistic and could never be fullfilled."	3	3		3																					
5449	6	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe."	3	3		3																					
5454	6	The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that	3	3		3																					
5457	6	"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the consept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obsticale that was faced was the strutural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 doolars' worth of modifications,"" The final obsticale was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities prooved to be challenging obsticales"	3	3		3																					
5458	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible.	3	3		3																					
5460	6	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be.	3	3		3																					
5461	6	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A morning mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on.	2	2		2																					
5464	6	The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.	3	3		3																					
5465	6	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Also the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. It would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars.	2	2		2																					
5467	6	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. The dirigibles waight and the wind pressure would add stress to the Building. Wich @CAPS1 to be transmitted more then @NUM1 ft down to the buildings foundation. Construction wasn't the only problem. Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @CAPS3 over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles Into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop. The finall problem was @CAPS5 already implace wich didn''t allow low flying aircrafts. Builders faced Problems with Nature, @CAPS5, safety, and construction wich lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system.	3	3		3																					
5469	6	many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. 	2	2		2																					
5472	6	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"".According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. An existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. @ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast."	2	3		3																					
5473	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where difficult. One of the obstecles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea impossible to happen."	2	3		3																					
5475	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many @CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted it discusses many of the @CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second @CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many @CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.	1	1		1																					
5476	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand foot dirigible on top the Empire state building could add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the Dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. There were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the empire state building.	2	2		2																					
5477	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger. ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners.""Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."""	2	2		2																					
5478	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	3		3																					
5479	6	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L�sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it."	3	3		3

5481	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues and the Empire @CAPS3 Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and building.	3	2		3																					
5482	6	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them."	3	3		3																					
5486	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which the desinged a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was to strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldnt due it because there was a law that airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5487	6	There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. they had to pay ove sixty thousand dollars worth of modificautions in to the buildings framework.	1	2		2																					
5488	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to figure out a way for the dirigibles to attach to the Empire State Building, in order for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"" (� 6). The builders also had to figure out a way to securly attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with a dirigible attached by only a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building's frame so they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building Also because of this, the builders had to edit the foundation, so it would not collapes if a durigible was attached. Finally the builders needed to overcome the simple nature they did not the winds on top of the building were shifting constantly and they are in a densely populated city so if things went wrong, many people could be harmed"	2	2		2																					
5494	6	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It way because of this, that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wins on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. It could also crash into other buildings. It could tear up the mooring mast. There was so much the builders didn't look into."	2	2		2																					
5495	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail.	3	3		3																					
5502	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered.	2	2		2																					
5503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed to the building all the way up to the 85th floor, But before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disasterous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but was a great idea involving future transportation."	3	3		3																					
5506	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the @CAPS1 face huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. First ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" The Reason for that is because the ""winds atop the building were allways changing due to the violet air currents"" ""Even if the dirigible were tethered  it would swivil around"" ""Also it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street it was not practical nor safe"" It would be really dangerase if they proceed in docking atop of the building.

5508	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself."	2	1		2																					
5510	6	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg accident in the highly populated New York City. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped.	3	2		3																					
5514	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia L�sted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."	2	3		3																					
5516	6	The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished.	2	3		3																					
5517	6	The @CAPS1 that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to all dirigible to dock there is that they @CAPS2 can't through on a top part to the building, they have to put it on piece by piece, or the building will become stressed to the point where it might collapse.	1	1		1																					
5518	6	"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there."	3	3		3																					
5520	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building.	3	2		3																					
5521	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach 1,250 feet beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desprite to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to create a landing spot for dirigibles. @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned. Instead, the @CAPS1 assigned to dirigible passengers was made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden.	0	0		0																					
5524	6	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back.Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable Being filled up with such a flamable gas it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground.	2	2		2																					
5525	6	The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock at the empire state building but there were a couple main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up. Those were some of the obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on to of the Empire State building.	2	1		2																					
5528	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with, while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the hight of the building. That ment more frame work, more material, more safety hazards, all because of the buildings hight. Another obstacle was @ORGANIZATION3 safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also wip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and  unsturdy for passengers. These are some of the obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
5531	6	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."	3	3		3																					
5532	6	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question"	3	3		3																					
5533	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flamibale. An accident would of been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown @CAPS1. Also nature proposed a big obstacle as well ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 there was an existing law against flying airships to low over urban areas."	2	2		2																					
5534	6	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
5535	6	"The Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are blimps. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building with just the size. The Empire State building was very competive with the Chrysler Building. Some oppinions were ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpast, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. There was also the obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. They added a mooring mast. There was many trials and tribulates making the Empire State building."	1	1		1																					
5536	6	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5538	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included, the structure of the building, the wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The stell frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down. This was clearly considered unsafe. Finally the safety of the passengers, was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Also, There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles.	3	3		3																					
5545	6	"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State building were always shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it."	2	2		2																					
5547	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.	2	2		2																					
5548	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main obstacles was, the lack of a good landing area. Dirigibles were pretty big and there wasn't a great spot for it. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as flour blocks in New York City""- paragraph 6. therefore caused problems to the builders to figure out where to put it."	2	1		2																					
5551	6	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger	3	2		3																					
5553	6	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible wer tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM2) These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast."	2	2		2																					
5556	6	In the story construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having a dirigible's dock ontop of the empire State Building was comming to an end. When thinking about the idea the architecture Never put thought in legal persasures as in air crafts cant fly low on urban areas. Also the heavy wind that picks up from the building making the air craft hard to controll. Another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians. If not @CAPS1 right the air craft can get loose and dingle down to urban areas or like the german dirigible catch on fire and Blow up. Even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air.	3	2		3																					
5557	6	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
5560	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast top of the building, to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, they couldn't do that because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was."	1	1		1																					
5562	6	Some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing it was hard/unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building.	1	2		2																					
5569	6	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead.	3	3		3																					
5570	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced alot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. They usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. In New York they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They worried an accident like the Hindenburg could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The Final obstacle was Forceful winds. They could blow the dirigible onto the Sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the Shell, the captain couldn't take his hands off the control levers. All in all the mooring mast was not a very well thoughtout idea and it would not have been safe at all.	3	3		3																					
5575	6	"THE OBSTACLES IS ""TO THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE MORNING MAST WAS NATURE ITSELF. THE WINDS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING WERE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING DUE TO VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS."""	1	1		1																					
5577	6	The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite.	3	3		3																					
5580	6	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work."	4	3		2																					
5582	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical"""	3	2		3																					
5584	6	The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that the had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the buildings structure wouldn't tear it apart. Also the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it.	2	2		2																					
5585	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia amidon @CAPS1 there was a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building.The first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. New York has alot of people in it and alot of buildings. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else.Secondly was safety. They had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building.Lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one was ever to fail it would probly kill someone. No one would ever get over what happened."	2	3		3																					
5586	6	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the empire state Building had to be modified and strengthened to accomodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe.	3	3		3																					
5587	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5589	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacle while building it, some of those obstacles being saftey, the technology they had, and, the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start.	3	3		3																					
5591	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws.Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated the city the outcome would be bad.The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe.There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it.The builders of the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5598	6	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed."	3	1		2																					
5601	6	The builders of the Empire State building were having many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first problem was that they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building. Mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Another @CAPS1 is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. For the creators of the building, The idea just seemed unpractical, a dirigible would be to hard to keep in one place dangling @NUM1 feet in the air above New York City.	3	2		3																					
5606	6	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped."	2	3		3																					
5608	6	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.	3	3		3																					
5610	6	"In the excerpt, ' The Mooring Mast' I Marcia Amidon L�sted, the constructors of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles a law against airships flying to low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place in paragraph @NUM1, it says ' The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the @CAPS1 is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed."	2	3		3																					
5611	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
5612	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."	3	3		3																					
5616	6	There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical.	2	2		2																					
5618	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (�@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2		2																					
5620	6	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law.	3	3		3																					
5621	6	"The builders of the @CAPS1 state building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. Their first problem was that it would add lots of stress to the building. This means if they had a dirigible tied up to the building in the wind it would put weigh on the building or pull it around. ""Nature was their greatest obstacle"" and it was very unsafe to have something like that hanging over the crowded streets of New York. In an atemp to make the building stronger the builders had to spend over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on the improvement of the skeleton or frame. There were also laws in place that did not allow large aircraft to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there. There were many problems and the landing of a dirigible on the empire state building never happened."	3	3		3																					
5622	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear.	3	2		3																					
5623	6	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles.	1	1		1																					
5624	6	Right now I going to tell us Some of the obtacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This is why never was completed the mooring mast (dirigible) for this serious obstacles to put this in the Empire state building.	3	3		3																					
5625	6	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the @DATE1's dirigibles were a big thing in transportation. The problem was that there wasn't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State building down.	3	2		3																					
5626	6	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tuge and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangers for passangers and the buildings foundation. However, making such attemps were eleagl for dirigibles to fly over urban areas, incase of failer. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach also in case of puncher. Spending sixty thousand on modification to moor mast on the @ORGANIZATION2 for the safe dock of dirigibles. The idea was lost to the creation of the mordern new airplane.	2	3		3																					
5628	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a mooring mast would add to much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas	3	2		3																					
5629	6	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part.The high wind was a problem.The dirigible could burn up fall down and people would die below.	1	2		2																					
5630	6	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.	3	3		3																					
5633	6	"The lack of the landing area. Also the body of the dirigible can Swing Is another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. The other obstacle they faced, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles were flying to low over the urban areas and that is a law against airships. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles could not get close enuff to tie up the dirigible do to the wind. Alot went wrong with transportation of Passengers so they stoped doing that."	2	3		3																					
5634	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the author States ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION2 ing's flat roof."" This was true because it would ""add stress to the buildings frame. Also paragraph @NUM2 states ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There were violent air currents, and landing techniques weren't promising. The builders had to use much caution because the idea of having a dirigible land at that height was neither practicle or safe."	2	2		2																					
5636	6	"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared."	3	3		3																					
5637	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" This quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work. To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe."" This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This quote explains the law about airships. Clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5638	6	Based ON this excerpt the builders faced A few problems when building the Empire State Building. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelin's or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at @NUM1 ft in the Air. Another problem the buiders faced with saftey. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was A fire saftey issue. This occurred After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, ON may 6, 1937.	2	2		2																					
5646	6	Based on excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles were that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	3		3																					
5651	6	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because its lacked of a suitable landing area, meaning it's to difficult for landing, it's not ment for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced."	2	2		2																					
5653	6	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets."	3	3		3																					
5659	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent.	3	2		3																					
5662	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obsticles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast."	3	3		3																					
5663	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building.	2	1		2																					
5664	6	"Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tied to a building. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5666	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3		3																					
5667	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the buildings frame."" (L�sted @NUM1) The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (L�sted @NUM1) ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (L�sted @NUM1) The building was based entirely around the mooring mast. New modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds."	3	4		3																					
5669	6	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.	3	3		3																					
5671	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low.	2	2		2																					
5674	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced Problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some Problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, also The winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. Another @CAPS1 the builders faced was a existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. They also had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building.	2	3		3																					
5675	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the architect and builders have to overcome very big obstacles while trying to make this plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around would hurt the buildings structure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 to build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building."	3	3		3																					
5676	6	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle is their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long ase one thousand feet long which is equal to four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This would add stress to the buildings frame and to dirigibles moored up their.	2	2		2																					
5678	6	The builders had a tough obstacle Because They in @CAPS1 were tryn to @CAPS2 A overall @CAPS3 Building. And were tryn to compete. The Dirigibles were A @CAPS3 part in Building The empire State Building Because They were faced with obstacles That were hard like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, Height and ext. These were the @CAPS7.

These are The reasons why This happens.	0	1		1																					
5679	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a large role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety conserns were getting passengers safely on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would shift due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (paragraph @NUM2). Due to nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5685	6	"The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. It was ""The winds on top of the building were contently shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the wind currents dirigibles would not be able for to stay still to allow the passengers to get off of the dirigiblel. They once tryed this. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible los Angeles approached the moorning mast but could not get close enouh to tie up bacase of forceful winds."" If the winds blue strong eneogh it could @CAPS1 the dirigible into a sharp object. After this atempd there was an; ""The building was an existing low against airships flying too low over urban areas."" ""It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" @CAPS2 any dirigibles could never tie up the the building because of this new law. The biggest obstacle was the winds. The winds were because it's put tremondos stress on the building."	3	3		3																					
5686	6	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In new York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is thousand-foot long. It would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrate framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The buiders faces so many obstacles.	1	1		1																					
5688	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical.	3	3		3																					
5691	6	"The builders and architects faced several different obstacles & dilemnas that intefered with the construction of the Empire State Building. One of them being the funds necessary in order to produce such a large structure. They found themselves constructing and reconstructing the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to reach the desired perfection. Another obstacle occurred when their entire concept shattered by the fact that not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium. The text reads, ""Most digribles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This displays the severity of the idea, where risks like that just could not be taken, so they abandoned the idea of the mooring mast."	1	1		1																					
5693	6	The builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 threw many obstacles. They consulted with experts taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The builders also had to meet with the president of a formed airship transport company.	1	1		1																					
5694	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing. New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas.	3	2		3																					
5695	6	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the @CAPS1. S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the @CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. Dirigibles is an old word for Blimps. The obstacle the @CAPS1.S.B. had to over come were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay @MONEY1 in modifications on the @CAPS1.S.B. for the framework. The second was nature, the winds would make the back of the Dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. Last but not least the law, the dirigibles cant be as low as the @CAPS1.S.B. because its too low and they cant fly low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
5696	6	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3																					
5698	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.	3	2		3																					
5705	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. L�sted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. L�sted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: L�sted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5707	6	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire wtate building never became a dirigible landing."	3	3		3																					
5708	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstactles in allowing drigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
5719	6	When building the empire state Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it @CAPS1, because the architect building the chrysler building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of new york, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was @CAPS2 the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used.	3	3		3																					
5720	6	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether"" then stress would be put on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over @MONEY1 modifying the framework (From paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 we read that the architects and builders worked through the obstacle of storage by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof""."	2	2		2																					
5721	6	Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didnt work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected. This is why the idea always stayed a dream.	2	3		3																					
5722	6	The obstical's the builder's took on Were difficult, and time @CAPS1. In Way's Such as the onley benefit's the Empire State building relly passed Was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to @CAPS2 a dirigible's docking base for future transportation @CAPS3 filed to do @CAPS4 during certain law's and technicall difficulties. @CAPS4 obsticles such as adding extra body work to the building's structure was not even neccarasary.Those are the obsticle's the builder's faced and as well as @CAPS5 time and @CAPS6.	1	1		1																					
5731	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there.	3	2		3																					
5735	6	"Marcia Amidon L�sted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (� @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as L�sted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5736	6	"There were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, they couldn't drop on mooring mass on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.     The @CAPS1 had to modified and strengthened the steelframe in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame Also creating the rocket shaped mass the @CAPS1 had to work on many different parts. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This had to be done presisely in order for everything towork     This were the obstacles the @CAPS1 face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State building."	2	2		2																					
5738	6	When building the Empire State Building, there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. So the architects have to motify it and stregthen the building. Spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new motification. The building will turn from @NUM1 floors to 102. From there dirigible passenger will board from there. In conclusion when building the Empire State Building there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
5739	6	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the wind. The captain feared he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured. ""[He] could not even take his hands off the control lever."""	3	3		3																					
5740	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.	2	2		2																					
5741	6	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, alot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put peoples safety at risk. One of the problems was the tail of the dirigibles would swirvle because of how high up it was the wind would be violent. Another problem that was stated in paragraph @NUM1 was forgeign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium so they were flamable.	2	2		2																					
5744	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were @CAPS1. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to  building's frame work."" This @CAPS3 that the designings of the Mast was going to take some time. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast. In @CAPS2 @NUM2 Architects @CAPS5 that, "" The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its @CAPS6 pose, for reasons that a pparent befrore it was even constructed.' The greates reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" @CAPS7 this was such a huge @CAPS8 the owners thought of the densely populated area of New York and how People could get hurt."	3	3		3																					
5746	6	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.	3	3		3																					
5747	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, They had to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting there life's in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical  problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a stark of any sort of Fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flameable, and if a wire were too short, it could like the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up.	1	2		2																					
5750	6	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some @ORGANIZATION1 of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service.	1	2		2																					
5754	6	"In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted. The obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced in @CAPS1 to Allow dirigible to dock there because people they was not gonna be safety. ""The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york"". Another example why the builder faced in @CAPS1 to Allow dirigibles to dock there because ""open landing field could be weighted dow in in the back with lead weight, dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". The empire states was not very safe. This is why the builders of the empire state building faced in @CAPS1 to allow dirigible to dock there."	2	1		2																					
5755	6	In the @DATE1's people did not have technology like we had today, they didnt know what they were really even doing. when the architecks were builing The @CAPS1 state builing they had many problems. First they couldnt just drop a mast on there because as they said in the story the roof was not flat. Next it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame and last they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof. All in all men in the @DATE1's had a lot of work to do while building the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																					
5757	6	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafly dangling high above pedestrians on the Street. There were many risk when landing the huge dirigibles and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrolably and crash into the Sharp Spires on other buildings around it. In @CAPS1 of becoming the of transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes.	3	3		3																					
5758	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are inpractable and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below."	1	2		1																					
5759	6	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers.	2	3		3																					
5760	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, There were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, natures winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks, in New York City."" Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."", doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested."	2	3		3																					
5762	6	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5769	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.	1	0		1																					
5772	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
5774	6	The Empire State Building faced alot promblems before it came out as an @ORGANIZATION1.  They scared that other people will destroy this Building.  So the reduced the dirigibles to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money. And other problem the some people didn't care and postpone to later.	0	0		0																					
5776	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable"". A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mask"", and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would of been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but aganst the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run."	3	2		3																					
5777	6	"In building the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unscure departure of passengers. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon made it impossible. "	2	3		3																					
5780	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.It stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".However, the greatest obstale was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting. which was certainly not safe. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved.Lastly, a more apparent obsticle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area.The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith's plan to become realistic."	3	3		3																					
5785	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it hard to build the Mooring.

In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse it would be if that happened in New York city which is highly populated."" @CAPS1 obstacle was mother Nature. Winds at the topof the building were constantly changing. In paragraph @NUM2 the author states ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The last obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3 the author states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""."	3	3		3																					
5786	6	The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse.	2	1		2																					
5788	6	"The idea of Hindenburg sized air ships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds propostorous in today's day in age. However in the 1920s this was a dream of many. Unfortunaetly this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the air ship itself, hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastorous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings. These two points aside, there was a ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality."	3	3		3																					
5790	6	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 builders must faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project."	3	3		3																					
5791	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith had the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S.. He wanted to out-do the Chrysler Building, Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His idea was to add a mooring mast. However, issues got in the way such as how highly flamable blimps were, how densely populated the city was, and the violent shifting winds.Blimps are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and hellium. on May 6, 1937, German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. New York City has millions of tourists a day, in such a populated area what if something went horribly wrong. The greatest issue was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1).On May 6, 1937 owners of the building concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building the tallest building was neither practical nor safe."	2	3		3																					
5795	6	"In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows had dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane."	3	2		3																					
5798	6	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse."	3	3		3																					
5799	6	"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building."	2	2		2																					
5800	6	In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face.	1	1		1																					
5806	6	One obstacle that the builders faced was that havin dirigibles hanging over a heavy populated area was extremely dangerous, because May 6, 1937 the german's dirigible was destroyed by fire, another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying to low over heavy populaded areas. So Al Smith had to let go of that plan.	2	2		2																					
5811	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced a lot of obstacles attempting dirigibles to dock their. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also realize that the dirigibles are flamable and if something were to go wrong it would cause a devestation to a such populated area. These obstacles put and end to the dream of having mooring mast on top of the Empire state building.	3	3		3																					
5815	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, adding stress to the biuldings frame. The steel frame of the bilding from top to bottom would have to be modified and strengthened to adress this new situation more than @MONEY1 was spent for modifications on the buildings framework.When the owners of the Empire State building found out about the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, they realized how much worse it could of bin if it happened right over down town New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen then that would be bad for the workers and anyone ealse around the building.	3	2		3																					
5817	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced the @CAPS2 of purfictle placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building which would of not worket out Because of the wind and there was no wait in the back that would of kept the dirigible in place in which now ment that the dirigible would have been swinging back and fort and gave the riesct of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousand of life at dinger. The @CAPS1 also faced the @CAPS2 of getting to micheenery that was needed to @CAPS4 the mooring mast. Another obstacle @CAPS1 had to face was getting aprover do to safety hasits because what had happing to the hindenburg in lakehurst, New Jersey.	3	3		3																					
5821	6	"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire state building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire state building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast."	3	3		3																					
5822	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth modifications to the building's framework. Also ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" make the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform."	3	2		3																					
5823	6	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5826	6	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."	3	3		3																					
5827	6	"The empire state building was high in the air, (@NUM1 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighting around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph @NUM2, @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then make new technology. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings."	1	1		1																					
5828	6	They could not put a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame.	1	1		1																					
5829	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical."	3	3		3																					
5830	6	When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped.	3	3		3																					
5831	6	well, since this one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area For the dirigibles. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line From the front of ship then tied to the Mast. But, then yet the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles load and the wind pressure would transmitte all the way to the building's Foundation. The steel Frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation.	3	2		3																					
5833	6	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3																					
5835	6	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attemting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommidate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, wich would puncture the dirigibles shell."	2	2		2																					
5837	6	Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.	1	1		1																					
5840	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigibles on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles.	2	2		2																					
5844	6	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end."	3	3		3																					
5847	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one just letting a thousand foot drigibles land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle.. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad. So the builder had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building. That was a huge obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to face."	2	1		2																					
5849	6	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to terner the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general. These obstacles proved far to many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.	2	1		2																					
5850	6	one of the obstacles that had to face was they had to make it taller because it was sapoosed to be the tallest building. They also had problems with it so they had to keep fixing it.	0	0		0																					
5851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1		2																					
5854	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked."	3	3		3																					
5855	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. The builders couldn't just let the dirigible land that the step of the Empire State building. It would put to much pressure on the building. According to paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" It would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modification had to be made to the framework. Another obstacle they feared was they noticed how much worse it would be if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population because it would be in downtown New York. In paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the State building, where they would dangle above pedestrians was not safe."	3	3		3																					
5856	6	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.	2	3		3																					
5858	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical. ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"""	1	1		1																					
5859	6	The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe.	2	2		2																					
5862	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project.	3	1		2																					
5863	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph @NUM1 states that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The architect on the building had to redesign the whole building so that it could accomodate these dirigibles. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" (� @NUM2). This is a monumental obstacle because safety and other issues would prohibit the mast from fulfilling its duties. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (� @NUM3). Heavy winds, pouring rains, and beating heat could all end in disaster for the urban area. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5864	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.

One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. There were many obstacles the builders went through."	3	3		3																					
5868	6	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.	2	3		3																					
5869	6	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building.	1	1		1																					
5871	6	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one.	2	3		3																					
5872	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow derigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents.	2	2		2																					
5877	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than hellium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 to the wind. L�sted informs us of the terrible hazard of the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end that is why it wasn't successful."	2	2		2																					
5880	6	"The builders of the empire state building had to face alot of obsticles to try to get dirgibles to land there. One of those obsticles was making ""changes to existing Plans for the building's stelfame"". Another thing was nature the winds would not let a blimp land there. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigables from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable""."	2	2		2																					
5881	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5884	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5889	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and Strengthened, which was over sixty thosand dollars 'worth. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were always shifting which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
5890	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring Mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from the outside the United States used hydrogen. The united States mainly used helium, witch is not flamable like hydrogen. Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the pedestrians down below. these are the obstacles the builders had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
5893	6	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
5896	6	"In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects and worker went through so many obsticales to then find out its dangerous and the law not to fly so close to urban area's."	3	3		3																					
5905	6	It @CAPS1 like a veryhard test for them because there trying to make an age of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton. They have framed the 85th floor the roof had to be completed before the framing.	1	1		1																					
5909	6	"The building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the very start Al Smith never thought about the safety of the people. ""When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium this was a cause for very flammible possibilities. If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."	3	3		3																					
5912	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.' Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed.	3	3		3																					
5913	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", There were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was the agianst airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough To tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high about pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
5914	6	"In the excert The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example One big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof."" This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand  foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings foundation, wich is nearly 11 hundred feet below."" the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new sittoation. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen rather than @CAPS3 lium, and @CAPS2 drogen is very flammable. the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but using them at the empire state building, were they would be hanging on top of padestrans on the street was neither practical nor safe. These are the obstacles the empire stat building faced."	3	3		3																					
5915	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And to let passengers on & off.Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, the law to fly too low. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared."	3	3		3																					
5917	6	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																					
5918	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory."	2	3		3																					
5920	6	Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 The owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York        In The MOORING MAST          Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty mile per hour and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling some were as longht as four blocks in New york city The one obstacle to their expanded us in New york city was the lack of a Suitable landing area	1	1		1																					
5924	6	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers.	1	1		1																					
5928	6	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose.	3	3		3																					
5929	6	Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.	1	1		1																					
5930	6	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. Used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced my obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2		2																					
5932	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1) The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking, was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible came to mind."	3	2		3																					
5933	6	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not going to do it because it might hit other building or fly into other self. ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2). That mean it wasn't safe."	1	1		1																					
5934	6	"Al Smith and other workers are working on Empire State Building. They been having a few obstales with the project like they can't have it has high as they wanted it. They had to fix the mast skeleton if they wanted to do more. The Dirigibles for example. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly  flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on @DATE1. This explains they had gotten a law after this from happening so they can't have things near the Urban areas. This proves that there were @CAPS1 with Empire State building that they worked around"	2	3		3																					
5936	6	They were many obstacles the @ORGANIZATION2 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the stress of the dirigibles's load and the wind pressure didn't allow to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, in which was nearly @NUM1 feet below. Another things that was an obstancle for the @ORGANIZATION2 was it was alot of money it was over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. The last obstacle was it safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States uses hydrogen rather then helim, which hydrogen is highly flamable. This let to a accident on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in dowtown New York. This are some obtecles the @ORGANIZATION2 of @ORGANIZATION2 faced.	3	3		3																					
5940	6	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they over looked several key factors. The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the diridible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hoovering over the streets of New York City."	2	3		3																					
5943	6	Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could of happened and something probably has happend, But back then they really had no choice except for balloons.	0	0		0																					
5944	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Those were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
5945	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.	2	1		2																					
5946	6	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build."	3	2		3																					
5947	6	One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area.	3	3		3																					
5948	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftyness will put stress on the buildings foundation and they don't want that stress to topal over the building. Also they say ""The winds on the top of the biulding were consistantly shifting due to the violant air current"". this says that they are worried  that the wind might take the balloon away from the building causing it to injure people these are only a few obsticals the builders had to face."	3	3		3																					
5949	6	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets.	2	3		2																					
5950	6	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
5951	6	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigables would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel."	3	2		3																					
5955	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
5960	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law."	3	3		3																					
5962	6	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building the builders had to reconstruct the entire building having to make is stronger to support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many hardships the workers had to face."	2	2		2																					
5963	6	"Obstacles the builders haded to face with the empire state building was that they did not had the enough technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. February 1931 @CAPS1 clavan of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a heigh made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear""     After @CAPS1 clavan said that the using of the dirigibles had dissappeared. by the late 1930s, the dirigibles had been given away to Airplanes. Also builder haded to construct electric winch and gang plank the electric winch is hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast, and gang plank to a open observation plataform.     "	1	0		1																					
5964	6	"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."""	1	2		2																					
5965	6	"At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however their were to many problems to make it a reality."	3	3		3																					
5966	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."""	1	1		1																					
5967	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders faced obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. An @CAPS1 the faced was A thosand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, this added stress to the buildings frame. the stress of the blimps load add plus wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. the steel frame of the Empire state building had to be strengthened to accommodate this."	1	1		1																					
5971	6	"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through alot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay."	1	1		1																					
5972	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to.	3	3		3																					
5975	6	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5976	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast."	3	2		3																					
5977	6	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.	1	2		2																					
5980	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders went through many obstacles to get their @CAPS1 done.The builders thought they had every all set and under controll. when they had made their plans they had planed for the mist to be a big pice. when they had made the mist it just wasn't right. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they had more problems because a law was p being passed that the ships could not tie them self to the buildings they wouldn't have anyone visit the building. But they solved that problem by haveing the airplanes bring the passengers. Even though the builders went through many obsticle they still managed to get passed them."	1	2		2																					
5982	6	"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flamable"". There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated. There were also whether problems. Winds were constantly shifting. ""Ship would swival around and around"".

5988	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."	3	3		3																					
5990	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City.The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building"	2	3		3																					
5992	6	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. They are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. It is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get to close and thats why they are droping the papers down with ropes @CAPS1 if they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building.	2	0		1																					
5993	6	"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attemp to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles."	3	3		3																					
5995	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" @CAPS1 how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness."	2	2		2																					
6000	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac.With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas."	2	2		2																					
6003	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	3	2		3																					
6005	6	Their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mass. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Those are some obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	2		3																					
6007	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attemply to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in @ORGANIZATION2 but, although adding space for landing The height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the @LOCATION2. -(Which would cost over @MONEY1) the Idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a @ORGANIZATION1 - they realized how dangerous that could be above densely populated area like New York City.	2	2		2																					
6009	6	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've of been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."""	3	3		3																					
6011	6	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety.	1	1		1																					
6012	6	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6013	6	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers."	1	2		1																					
6014	6	The problems that were faced was that the ships could get blown by the wind a hit buildings. Than they thought of putting weighos on the shp, but than they could fall off and hit people on the ground.	1	1		1																					
6016	6	"The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-skraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obsticles to fufil. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm.  Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accomidate the ""blimps"" passengers.  And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the @NUM1 and 102 floors.  Smith's men worked hard and over came many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building"	2	1		2																					
6021	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite aparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passangers and bystanders safety. The dirigible could become uncontrollable putting many lives in danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building.	2	2		2																					
6024	6	The first obstical came when the @PERSON1 builing had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the empire state builbing @NUM1 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Then with the new laws and the hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work-out. So the gave up trying to make it useful.	1	1		1																					
6027	6	When constructing the mooring mast on top of the empire state building it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probaly one of the biggest issue for the mooring mast. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen of helium. Thus causing a higher risk to explode. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid what would happen if it occured above downtown Nature was belived to be its biggest obstacle. Winds at the top of the air awalys shifted violently due to air currents. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast @CAPS1 were another major reason. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over Urban areas. Making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was. Al Smith really should have done some more studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
6028	6	The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have poped it. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. Especially in a crowded area such as New York.	2	2		2																					
6029	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast such as the Los Angeles and Columbia but the mast was never put to good use and shows the Problems with inovating things already @CAPS1 as the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6031	6	"Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" @CAPS1 some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and be destroyed by flammable gas. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved."""	3	3		3																					
6032	6	After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly.	2	3		3																					
6033	6	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.	3	2		3																					
6034	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3		3																					
6036	6	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigibles to dock a the top of the empire state building. One it may get very densely populated with taller buildings. Since they had never made one before something could go wrong And last like the Hindenburg another disaster like that could happen but This time in a densly populated city	1	1		1																					
6037	6	"While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast."	2	2		3																					
6039	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire state. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph @NUM1, L�sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was for the better that they decided against it."	3	3		3																					
6040	6	"Base on the excerpt, the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. My prodiction is he doesn't want it around because the Empire State Building is way to high and the blimps is like floating Right above it. Something may have, thats what I think Al Smith is worried about. My backup answer is the statement he said ""it's on the level, all right. ""No kidding"". We're on the thing now. One set of engineer here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"" it seems like hes confused about the whole situation."	0	0		0																					
6041	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast.	2	3		3																					
6043	6	"Based on the expert, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish because it's against the law."	3	3		3																					
6048	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building.The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use because they would hanging over crowded streets.Another problem was added stress to the buildings Foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster.	3	3		3																					
6052	6	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."	2	3		3																					
6053	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it will add stress to the buildings frame. The architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they are doing. Before putting the mooring mast the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to have the overall shape of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed. when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up. So in the future ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not work out."	2	1		2

6055	6	When the Empire State Building was @NUM1 conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That plus a @NUM2 ft dirigible moored at the top, we had stressed to the building's fram. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building, was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	2	3		3																					
6057	6	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians.	3	2		3																					
6059	6	The obstacles of The @CAPS1 of Them Empire state building were some big ones which led to some Problems. for @CAPS2, There was a lack of a, Landing area for the Dirigible.

The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2		2																					
6064	6	"The obstacles the builder's of the Empire state Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety, nature itself and the law.Safety because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and accident could happen like ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians.Law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.

6065	6	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architecture who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expand use in New York city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top or the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the buildings frame. They finally build the mooring mast and they raised the American flag again."	1	2		2

Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it state that the dirigible a extreamely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt.	1	1		1																					
6077	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.	1	2		2																					
6078	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																					
6081	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.	1	1		1																					
6082	6	The obstacles that the builders of the empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there work, there wasn't enough room, they weren't supposed to have aircraft near the city.	1	1		1																					
6083	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the unstability of the aircraft being docked.	1	2		2																					
6084	6	the builder of the empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because they had to plan out how it would what they would need to use for it to dock there. What kinds of material would be needed in this project and how it would work. Before actually putting it all together.	0	0		0																					
6087	6	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe.	3	3		3																					
6090	6	"As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched THe first problem thay encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the buildings framework, @CAPS1 they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremly to risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock."	3	3		3																					
6095	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream.	3	3		3																					
6096	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason.	3	3		3																					
6098	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe."	2	2		2																					
6101	6	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.	2	2		2																					
6102	6	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 a baloon and dirigible may have the same appearance the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly which is highly flamable. Secondly there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured it could collaps into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
6104	6	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad."	3	3		3																					
6107	6	The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was supposed to reach @NUM1 feet, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the @CAPS1 Building snuck up and stuck a 46 foot pole on top. Of course the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @CAPS2 of New York and Architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the Building, and also, since  zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1. All in all, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was built for disaster	2	2		2																					
6108	6	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2,	2	2		2																					
6109	6	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.	3	3		3																					
6112	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway.	3	3		3																					
6114	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow diigibles to dock there. The builders were in a compition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush and really @CAPS1 for this. The archetes had to find a way to build this mast. ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modification had to be made to the building's framework"". They had to fix the framework of the building so the wind woldent affect the rest of the building. ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's fundation."" The builder and archetes had to overcome the reality to. It was not safe and dirigibles are highly flammable. It wald be a terrible accident if one eliminated in the city. Also many laws @CAPS2 airships flying low in urban areas. The builders had to face many Problems while trying to build the tallest building."	3	3		3																					
6115	6	"The main obstical was to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps can land on it to drop-off/pick up passengers and refule. They had ""@NUM1 thousand dollars"" in renovations to sturdy the structure of the tower. they couldnt make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of an @NUM2 foot ship + cargo."	2	2		2																					
6120	6	During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be.	3	3		3																					
6123	6	"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.first off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this. ""The greatest obstical to the suceessful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"", (@CAPS2 @NUM3)As you can see, these architects faced many challenges while building this mast, that saddly never paid off in the end."	3	3		3																					
6130	6	"In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced Problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard. For example ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never dock a dirigible at the Empire State building"	3	3		3																					
6131	6	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerouss. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to there much safer usual landing of open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues.	3	3		3																					
6132	6	The biggest obsticle was safely. The foriegn dirigibles use Hydrogen (@NUM1) gas as a means to fly but hydrogen gas is highly flamable. The owners of the Empire State Building were consernd because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst, @LOCATION2. The Hindenburg bursted into flames and in less than one minute there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities.	1	1		1																					
6135	6	The builders had many obstacles while building the Empire State building. They had competition with the Chrysler building because of it's height. Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State wanted to build the tallet and most famous building in the world. He made the buildings seem invincable. He even put a mooring mast on it so things could land on it. But it was never suppost to surve that purpouse, It was only created for publicity. Because about the mooring mast the building would have failed to become popular. Al Smith did everything to make that building what it is today and it is still standing in New York city today.	0	0		0

6144	6	From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire state building were numerous. an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. another was controll of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently. Safety as well as an issue, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeplin caught fire and exploded. 	2	3		3																					
6146	6	"The obstacles the builders faced building the Empire State Building were; the safety, the time.The safety of building the top the Empire State Building got in the way because, it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. Another reason why it was unsafe because if some of the glass or steel part got pushed off the people down be low. Another reason is the blinps flying to close to the buildings and hitting one of them. Also the passengers going on and off of the blinp; they needed to find away that the passengers wouldn't get hurt.The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough.

6150	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place.	3	3		3																					
6153	6	First of all the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible.	1	2		2

6159	6	"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon L�sted tell about the Empire State building, & it's enormousity. Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
6161	6	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.	3	3		3																					
6164	6	Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders faced. was that they had to go to the base of the building to make it taller. This is The obstacles that they faced.	0	0		0																					
6165	6	Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, @CAPS1 that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather.Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also @CAPS1 forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Piolets were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
6167	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building.	2	2		2																					
6168	6	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the empire state building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't thought about the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships. If they had hit a neiboring building the results could be disastrous."	2	3		3																					
6169	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @ORGANIZATION1, the builders had to redesign the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. They went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. Second, the had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now"""	2	2		2																					
6174	6	The Empire State Building was in construction the building passed for many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world and they had to work hard. The State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reason that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed	0	0		0																					
6175	6	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6176	6	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety. The strong winds would almost make it imposible to hold it steady at the top while the weak structure would almost make it imposible to hold saflley at the top. with all of these hazards it is compleatly unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building.	3	2		3																					
6178	6	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.	3	2		3																					
6179	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacals when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would put stress on the buildings fam. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Theese are the obstacals they had to @ORGANIZATION1.	2	1		2																					
6181	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in down town New York.The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents. Also dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below.The last reason is because their was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it.	3	2		3																					
6183	6	"Based on the excerpt It shows in some way's there were obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles or Blimps to dock there. One of those examles were found in paragraph @NUM1. It said ""The mooring mast of the empire State building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Another One was Also in paragraph @NUM1 when they said ""The greatest reason was one of safty: Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in lakehurst, New, Jersey, the owners of the empire state building relized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated Area such as downtown New York. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says that nature was a big obsticle for the success of the mooring mast. The winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas."	3	3		3																					
6184	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted There were important obstacles The builders of the Empire State Building faced for the dirigibles to dock and becomes stationary there. The dirigible was highly flammable, struchure was unsafe laws and it was @CAPS4 prmitting for them to dock There.One, The dirigibles are highly flammable to have have near a building that has so much importance to its @CAPS1. ""Today These dirigibles are camo. fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have lighter in the air."" These dirigibles in the U.S only have hydrogen which is the ultimate firestarter.Second, the structure never passed for a human passenger to get on The structure and ride The blimp. The law states ""aircraft flying low to urban areas is @CAPS2."" @CAPS3 why it never could happen.Third, @CAPS4 can never always be right twenty-four seven. The problem is ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting violent air currents."" This Put lives in @CAPS5, these were obstacles in The dirigibles docking."	3	3		3																					
6187	6	When the empire state building was faced with @CAPS1 a dirigible docking station they encountered many Problems. The first @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 encountered was the wind. The wind over a thousand feet in the air is never going to be @CAPS4. Once they got the dirigible @CAPS5 to the tower there would be no way they Could keep it still enough to refule and let passangers on or off the dirigible. The Second @CAPS2 they ran into was helium is flammable. If somehow that helium @CAPS7 fire it would be @CAPS8 in such a Place as downtown New York. The third and final reason is it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city. There was no way this was going to work out so they stopped moving forward on this @CAPS9.	3	3		3																					
6188	6	"The @ORGANIZATION1 spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating. The spire was actually a mooring mast to be used for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were thought to be the transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to make the Empire State Building and all of New York on the fore front of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand a dirigibles weight so, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked with at endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse..."" if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Building a mooring mast on the empire state building and many obstacles involved."	3	3		3																					
6190	6	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the united states. The hydrogen was very flamable and the would not be able to stand a fire in such a high populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The winds from nature would make it hard to control the dirigible so people were afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. Those were some of the obstacles that were faced.	3	2		3																					
6191	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey it would have been more dangerous over a densey populated area like New York where the Empire State building was. the greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were shifting due to air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The major problem architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it has a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was not practical or safe.	3	3		3																					
6194	6	The builders were Building about @NUM1 ft high Above surface, so Safety is an issue. Then a @NUM2 ft @CAPS2 would moore, at the top of Building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building (@CAPS2 load would). Also, The Wind pressure would have to be transmitted @NUM3 ft below to the foundation. So its a @CAPS1 that could affect @CAPS3. The @CAPS2 could catch on fire on top of Downtown New York hurting @CAPS3 And its costing a lot of money @NUM4 Dollars.	2	3		3																					
6195	6	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all.	3	3		3																					
6197	6	"The architects, engineers, and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock the top of the building. The first troubling encounter for the builders was they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building."" The engineers and architects needed to make @NUM1 dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the buildings frame work. Mother nature herself was also a problem. The constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down. Even weighing down the zeppelins proposed a threat of a weight falling and killing an innocent person. lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying to low over a city. If a spike from another building hit and popped the ballon, there would be an absolute disaster. Overall there were many obstacles preventing the idea of a dirigible dock to ever become true."	3	3		3																					
6198	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders faced quite a few problems. They faced on constructing the building. They didn't know if they could built it all. They also faced a bad climate, and faced on how much did the dirigibles weighted and if they can hold it. On paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" These are a few things that the workers had to face"	1	1		1																					
6200	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned the idea."	2	3		3																					
6203	6	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast a top the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the frame work of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" @CAPS1, the building had to have two extra floors added one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigidle passengers. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building."	2	2		3																					
6206	6	"In The mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the reason for the tall spire was revealed as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. there were many difficultys faced by the builders of the Empire state building in attempt for zeppelins to actually land there. on difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible ""over @NUM1 $ of work was done to the foundation. This was difficult because it could think adding that much steel to a beautiful building couldn't be easy. anouther difficulty addition involved ""the mast... would to a conical head this would house a mooring arm"" think about how easy it is to take a ornate @NUM2 foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top, not easy. Last ""the winds at top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" this means all the framing workers went through hell to make the building."	2	2		2																					
6208	6	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the empire state building would make it dangerous and unsafe for Dirigibles to dock with the building."	3	3		3																					
6210	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top @CAPS1 ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible the Empire state building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" Even though that's possible there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders faced many obstacles that set them back but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true."	2	3		3																					
6211	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building.	1	2		2																					
6212	6	"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building."	3	3		3																					
6213	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building. Many obstacles came upon the builders."	2	2		2																					
6216	6	"There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting the president of a airship transport company and the plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building."	1	1		1

Another obstacle that they faced is that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over suburban areas. The greatest obstacle is the violent air currents would make the back of the Ship swivel around the mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
6218	6	I think the builders main problem they faced was making sure people would be able to safely get off the dirigibles and onto the actual building.They would also need to make sure that the blimp wouldn't burst into flames if it came close or crashed into the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																					
6219	6	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building. Finally these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders fixed."	2	2		2																					
6221	6	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire state faced was the lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.

The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	2	2		2																					
6222	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. difficult. One difficulty that they had was that the mooring mast nature it self. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, and the only way that they could moor is if the weighted down the back, and using them at the Empire State Building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you.Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law was against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. this was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back.These are just some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock.	3	3		3																					
6223	6	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles.	3	3		3																					
6225	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influentiel obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the Winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe.""Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship took even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1, the mooring mast idea was dropped."	3	3		3																					
6228	6	"The builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played as a big obsticle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
6232	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face being up in the air for so long They also had to face trying to dock the dirigible on top of the roof while still stay saft themselfs	0	1		1																					
6234	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose."	2	2		2																					
6235	6	The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who where constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole idea.Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attahed to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builder are going to try this con cept which means they have to lead by example. If not then the other builders would have major problems people would be in danger.The builders and men who thought about using weights to balence off the weight of the ship. They needed to find a safe way accomplish this and unforunantly they could not. If they went through with it, one accident could have killed many people.The Dirigible was a great idea but they should have thought out the ideas before they went ahead and built it.	2	2		2																					
6237	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in building a dock for dirigibles. One of the problems they faced was that the did not have suitable landing area. In paragraph six it said that it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours. Also they had realized that most dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen insted of helium which was more highly flammable. In paragraph thirteen they said that an accident could have been worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."	2	2		2																					
6238	6	"The @CAPS1 had many obstacles Building the Empire State Building and also allowing Dirigibles to @CAPS2 there. one of the obstacles was the expanded use in New York City. As said on page @NUM1 paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area"". Another obstacle was use of mooring mast was Nature itself. Also said on pg @NUM2 paragraph @NUM3. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself"". The @CAPS3 Obstacle was weather for an example On page @NUM4 paragraph @NUM5 ""The @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast But could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" @CAPS4 are @NUM2 concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2 near Empire State Building."	3	1		3																					
6239	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A couple of those obstacles are one, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This is happening because ""the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"" Which means they would have to go nearly eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is They figured out that ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The reasons for this is because it should have been apparent before was ever constructed. Those are just a couple of many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced."	1	2		2																					
6241	6	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York.	3	3		3																					
6242	6	"The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay."	3	3		3																					
6245	6	The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldnt be very safe have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldnt stop and went straight into the tower.

6248	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea. Which the constructers later came to realize."	3	3		3

6253	6	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. This shows prof of the project's incapability to be built."	3	3		3																					
6254	6	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al @ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 would be constructed to dock drigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the @ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is that the higher altitude @CAPS1 get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) @CAPS1 will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City, if there were any mistakes a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the @DATE1's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society."	3	1		3																					
6256	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in @LOCATION1 would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	3		3																					
6257	6	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.	2	3		3																					
6258	6	"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building, created obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""	3	3		3																					
6259	6	The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure @CAPS1, If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big citie's streets. Finally, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable. That is why the mooring mast was dangerous.	1	2		2

Furthermore, an additional obsticle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles.

6263	6	It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way. One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted it larger and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at that height were very rigorous and with a highly populated area, they did not want an accident to occur. Allowing docs up on the Empire State Building was very dangerous.	1	2		2																					
6265	6	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spining around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles, would swivel around the mast unless tied down. The next problem or obstacle was making the buildings structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The next challenge was to create a safe enviroment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The drigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Clearly the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	3	3		3																					
6267	6	Al Smith and his workers, went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen, meant HIGHLY flammable.	3	3		3																					
6268	6	"In the novel the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Because in the novel it said ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""

6270	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they the top of the building. These currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous. The builders and architects try to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights.""

""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. L�sted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As L�sted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City.

As L�sted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"".

Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building."	3	2		3

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high. this idea presented many challenges."	1	2		2

6297	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps to dock there.

6298	6	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work.	2	3		3																					
6300	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die.	3	3		3																					
6301	6	"While building the mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building struggled through many difficulties and issues. First they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station."	3	2		3																					
6302	6	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.

After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come.

6307	6	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it.	2	2		2																					
6308	6	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" That flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia L�sted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State building was never used to dock dirigibles."	3	2		3																					
6309	6	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because must dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6310	6	The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6311	6	The builders of the Empire State built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. They had a view in those floors, and was the idea didn't work, they wasted money on those extra rooms.They started working on the build and attempt to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted alot of time and money, and it was just a waste altogether.	0	1		1																					
6313	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.      Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street."	3	3		3																					
6315	6	When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first @CAPS1 about it seemed like a brilliant idea But as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a Mooring dock stayed just an idea. When the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling it purpose. The greatest @CAPS2 hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The Winds at that height were strong, violent and constantly Shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swireled around the mooring mast.Another hazard was that most dirigiples from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that @CAPS3. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against Airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building.	3	3		3																					
6317	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.' This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area. The idea of docking dirigibles at the empire state building were ignored."	4	3		3																					
6319	6	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. Those are some of the obstacle they had to allow the dirigibles to dock there.	1	1		1																					
6320	6	"When allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown new york"". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york.

6321	6	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the @CAPS1. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to @CAPS1 there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's.  Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the @CAPS1 from ever being used.	2	2		2																					
6323	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire state building. @PERSON1 says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame. So the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of thier building. Also because of everything that could happen to the building."	2	3		2																					
6324	6	"The Mooring @CAPS1 the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. Building a mast is more complicated than you would think, they had to take alot of things into consideration like the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Just when the builders thought they were done Al Smith adds a 250 foot Mooring Mast to the top of the Empire State building. The builders had to go through alot of obstacles and challenges to complete this project, but they did."	2	2		2																					
6325	6	Obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	1	2		2																					
6326	6	The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building they went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses having the blimp sit on top of building. Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord it was appling stress to the build because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up the wind was excrushiating. The last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps. If they used hydrogen which is a highly flammable substance, like the German blimbs it could of been bad.	2	3		3																					
6327	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law. In paragraph @NUM1 saying the reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state Building cause of an existing law against airship flying too low under urban area and the law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie or even approach the mooring mast.	1	2		2																					
6329	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @NUM1.The first obstacle was ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there.There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Which meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, something like that didn't come cheap, in fact ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.""In all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure. The most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden. And the highest observation deck has never been open to the public."	3	3		3																					
6336	6	In order to build the Empire State building, some Of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engeineeres and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it.	2	1		2																					
6338	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3		3																					
6339	6	In the process of building the empire state building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire state building.In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building they had to streghten, the whale foundation. If a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed.Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building	2	2		2																					
6340	6	In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability.	2	1		2																					
6341	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast.In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the @ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over @MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
6342	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money! Those are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6343	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (L�sted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
6345	6	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction.	3	3		3																					
6348	6	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds, the winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship, they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts to low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't gonna to work.	3	2		3																					
6349	6	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.	2	2		2																					
6352	6	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. "	3	3		3																					
6357	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could of been it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1"". It is a good thing they did not do the idea."	2	2		2																					
6361	6	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in Building the tallest building, The Empire State building."	1	3		1																					
6362	6	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, dock there. One of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles."	2	1		2																					
6363	6	One obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building in attempt to allow dirigibles was, the stress from the mass & the dirigible and wind pressure would all be transmitted to the buildings foundation. The frame of the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate the new situation. There were also safety reasons. Since most states used hydrogen in stead of helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire. The fire could destroy New York City since it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Plus it	3	3		3																					
6367	6	"Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put to much pressure on the building frame, another was the baloon it's self, besides the U.S. most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to fly/hold or dock a air craft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State building brought many issues and delemas making it hard to carry out such a idea for such a tall building."	3	3		3																					
6369	6	The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.	3	3		3																					
6370	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.	3	3		3																					
6372	6	Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built.One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky. Another, obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. Their was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was discussed a lot of time and money would have been saved.	3	3		3																					
6376	6	"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out."	3	3		3																					
6377	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to thier expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, also saw a opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Also dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow dirigibles to be docked.	1	1		1																					
6380	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. L�sted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (L�sted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. L�sted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (L�sted @NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
6381	6	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (� @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" (� @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (� @NUM2) the architects should've thought their plan through better."	3	3		3																					
6382	6	There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foriegn countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is very flamlable, therefore the dirigible might explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying to low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles. Those are some problems the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles.	2	3		3																					
6383	6	"In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars. So they build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Those were the obstacles in making a moor mast."	2	2		2																					
6385	6	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below.	1	2		2

Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system.

All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing."	3	2		2																					
6406	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing.	1	1		1																					
6407	6	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.	3	2		3																					
6412	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3																					
6413	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6414	6	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."	3	3		3																					
6415	6	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
6424	6	Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible.	3	3		3																					
6426	6	The @CAPS1 of the empire state building had to cross many obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if dirigible docked on the building its weight would be to much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by rienforcing the building's supports. The largest obstacle and the one that defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building. For example when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los @CAPS2 tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was unable to, do to the fiercely forceful winds. In the end the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles.	3	2		3																					
6427	6	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast.As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was haulted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing.	2	2		2																					
6428	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.       One obstacal the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though the dirigible were tyed dow to the mass, the ship would swivle around the mooring mass. This would make it unsafe for pedestrians.       Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly Flammable. When a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3 owners of the Empire State Building relized that accident would be much worse in down town New York.	3	3		3																					
6429	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
6430	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
6432	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (�@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6434	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.	3	2		3																					
6437	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area."	2	2		2																					
6438	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out."	3	3		3																					
6439	6	"Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way. Dirigibles themselves, were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is very flammable, and would not be safe near large crowds of people, like in an urban area like New York. From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds @CAPS1 it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that  airships were not to fly too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan summed it up when he said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" However, technology soon made dirigibles outdated."	3	2		3																					
6442	6	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.	1	1		1																					
6445	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.	1	2		2																					
6447	6	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building. The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this out better.	3	3		3																					
6450	6	"The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest. This ment that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made."	1	2		2																					
6452	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. It would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced."	1	1		1																					
6454	6	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building	3	2		3																					
6456	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
6457	6	After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects want to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, ad after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 up in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
6458	6	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off as stated in para graph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. Also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people. These are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow drigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building."	3	3		3																					
6460	6	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof The stress from a thousand foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthend. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a steeped-back design that imitated the overall shapp of the building itself."" This rocket shapped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery. Finnally, when this was all completed the existing plans for the building were to be put in place."	1	1		1																					
6462	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such ""Violent air currents"" (� @NUM1), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (� @NUM2), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered be attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6463	6	In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will @CAPS2 from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to make afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily.	1	1		1																					
6464	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1) if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality."	2	2		2																					
6465	6	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. 	2	3		3																					
6466	6	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."""	2	3		3																					
6467	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just to great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."	3	3		3																					
6469	6	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, we have learned of the obstacles the builders were faced with. The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was set in place for safety reasons. Due to the two main obstacles; nature and law, builders, wern't able to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	2		2																					
6470	6	The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city.Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk.Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical.	4	3		3																					
6473	6	Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that, natural causes like high winds said in � 6. The dirigibles were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gases that made the dirigibles fly. Also another important factor was that this project was being taken place in a highly populated area, which meant harm could be done civilians if anything ever went wrong.	1	2		2																					
6475	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building is that they Could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law agains airships flying too low over Urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.	2	1		2
