2	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, �brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. � and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
8	3	The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they @CAPS1 don�t care about the cyclist. I�m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don�t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don�t care about the affects of the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
10	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, �the sun was beginning to beat down.� @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain�s a person�s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; �The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie�s story, �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
16	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2		2																					
22	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
23	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he�d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn�t ever take shortcuts again	2	2		2																					
27	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.	1	1		1																					
29	3	The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park	2	2		2																					
34	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason�s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it�s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That�s why they chase the mode.  	0	0		0																					
47	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1		1																					
49	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In �Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit� the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how �The sun was beginning to beat down� expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their �shortcut.� Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with �one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest male.� @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a �battery-acid� flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he �had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.� His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn�t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																					
58	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone �I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path� he also. Though he was in a ghost town. �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
62	3	In the essay � Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
67	3	The cyclist was well prepaired for his adventure however hot enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
68	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn�t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1		1																					
70	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
72	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist�s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, � I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph� This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																					
73	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty ��. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. �when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. �Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1		1																					
74	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn�t be in a place that�s dry.Like in the story it says �I was travelling through the high parts of California in June� meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text �I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back� which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it�s a bad place for them to ride.	2	2		2																					
75	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1		1																					
76	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
78	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author�s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1		1																					
85	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch�s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
89	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1		1																					
93	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist�s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in �the high deserts of California in June,� the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2		2																					
103	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
108	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says �there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
109	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn�t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
115	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1		1																					
116	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1		1																					
118	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ��A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2																					
123	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the fisrt �toun�. The setting of the desert affected the cyclilst because the cyclist, because cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of driead sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? that should drop from heatsroke on a gorqeas day in june simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their ??? ???, ??? to tough. This my responese to the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
125	3	"During the passage �Do not exceed speed limit�, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in �The high deserts of California in June�. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says �over one long, crippling hill,� This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way."	2	2		2																					
127	3	"In the stories, don�t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
132	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn�t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn�t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																					
133	3	The features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the �ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral� This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of �battery acid.� It also goes on to say that it was a �test for my inner spirit.� It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2		2																					
138	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of �california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.� @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
140	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.� The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it �He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills �So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2		3																					
148	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1		1																					
154	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																					
155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn�t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																					
159	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																					
160	3	In �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a �shortcut� to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
162	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
165	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says � The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don�t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh�. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2		3																					
166	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he�s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn�t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.� Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn�t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was� summer time� it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2		3																					
168	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
170	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
181	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																					
183	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
184	3	Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.	2	2		2																					
193	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist�s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.� In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "	3	3		3																					
197	3	"In the setting of � Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit.� The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when �old-timers� told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt.� So the cyclist used that information and it wasn�t for   The Better."	1	1		1																					
198	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like � yes sir! I own a very good map� so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future.	1	1		1																					
200	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3		3																					
203	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to �short, rolling hills�. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but �tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.� He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. 	2	3		3																					
206	3	In the story �Rough road ahead� the setting affect�s the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. �The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,� this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story.	1	1		1																					
208	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down.	1	2		2																					
210	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar	0	0		0																					
215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																					
216	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn�t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. �When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. �the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,� (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																					
217	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die��. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3		3																					
218	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.� That sign if he didn�t see it he would have over the speed or didn�t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1		1																					
223	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says �the sun was beating on me� this shows it was hot. Thats one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
229	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0		0																					
236	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1	1		1																					
237	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert.	1	1		1																					
243	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2		2																					
244	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn�t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he @MONTH1 die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat �might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war�. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says �I was going to lie�slowly gaining elevation while losing hope�. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson. 	3	2		3																					
262	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, ��Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, �� and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke��. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2	3		3																					
264	3	It affect cyclest because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel.	1	1		1																					
266	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
268	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes �that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,� before the last word war.� But any �town� he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,�It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But �hope was fading.� Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven�t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																					
270	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn�t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
271	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources � especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. �I was going to die� he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3	3		3																					
272	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how �I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out �this breezy jaunt.� The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3		3																					
273	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  	1	1		1																					
274	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat�. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective.	1	1		1																					
275	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strongs legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."	2	3		3																					
276	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. �This site was trebling.�  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn�t good. �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees�. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can�t believe his luck.� Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me �The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3	2		3																					
280	3	If the sun had not been so  blaring all the road so trecharous. Also the �devation� often bothers the author because he had to get over the dry and dehydrtion.	1	1		1																					
281	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																					
285	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would�ve lasted longer and he would�ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would�ve died. Luckily though it wasn�t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could�nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I�ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3	3		3																					
289	3	The setting of the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.� It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on �the sun was beginning to beat down� He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. �I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. �The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.	2	3		3																					
295	3	The features of setting affects the cyclist because the setting then you won�t had, lots on hills. Also there was no water. For example, in the story He says in was were hilly area. Also he says that there are no buliding he is all by him self which @MONTH1 make him scared. So the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot dry cimate with no water and no builiding; and no peole to ask for direcions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him.	1	1		1																					
296	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
299	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren�t up to date nowadays.	1	1		1																					
300	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. �Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice�� (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.	1	1		1																					
307	3	"The features of the setting affets the cyclist in afew ways. For example, the features of the �Rough Road� didnt allow him to arive as fast so was drive @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit. Second the fact that he was drivuing through a desert a large snake made its way on the Road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehidrated state.� @CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert,hegot so hot & started to get dehydrated of lack of water. Lastly the features that there werent any buildings far miles so he was left lost and didnt have anywhere to stop & ask for directions. These few features defenitly affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
311	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn�t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they�ll do.	2	1		2																					
312	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																					
313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn�t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
318	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn�t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn�t know much didn�t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0	0		0																					
322	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, �I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, �Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I�d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
335	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states �looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, �it didn�t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.� This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
336	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.	1	1		1																					
338	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,� prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1		1																					
344	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the �beautiful @DATE1.� He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that�s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.	2	2		2																					
351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
352	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, �sometimes life can feel so cruel�, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, �somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3		3																					
354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.	3	2		3																					
357	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�many features of the setting challenge the cyclists.The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake.After realizing this he,�I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and i was traveling through the high deserts of California,in June�the lack of water plus the heat in California,in june would have turned to heatstroke for most people.Even further into the journey,even with all those things against him it states,�flat rode was replaced by short,rolling hills,""@CAPS1 not only did he have excessive heat,and no water,but @CAPS1 he was handed troublesome rodes too.Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion,he continued through.Fighting all adds,and elements,many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist,but he overcame them honorably."	3	2		3																					
359	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.� brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. �and� had the flavor of battery acid.� Then he came upon �rolling  hills� and �Rough @CAPS1.� By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn�t get directions from old guys. 	2	2		2																					
366	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, �over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.� This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.� These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
371	3	In the article �Do not exceed the posted speed limit,� the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.� The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.	3	3		3																					
372	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. �There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind �(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1		2																					
377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that � He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.� This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says � I checked my water supply.� @CAPS1 means he�s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this	2	2		2																					
378	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.	1	1		1																					
382	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, A cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will staying he met some old people who gave him a �short cut�. As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there	2	2		2																					
387	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive.	1	2		2																					
388	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states �with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind�, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3	3		3																					
391	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.	1	1		1																					
394	3	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map.	2	1		2																					
396	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn�t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water.	2	2		2																					
397	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
398	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This was in response to the first �town� he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.	2	2		2																					
401	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over �short, rolling hills.� Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn�t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits �the traditional definition of a ghost town� and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2		3																					
408	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel�. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. � From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																					
410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
412	3	The cyclist in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can�t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier.	1	2		2																					
416	3	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river	1	1		1																					
417	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don�t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
421	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
436	3	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.	1	1		1																					
437	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, �Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.� For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, �A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, �Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
438	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???	1	1		1																					
440	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, ��@CAPS1 blues tune �summer time� rattled around in�my deteriorating brain.� The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It�s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it�s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, ��haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2	2		2																					
441	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist�s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, �with strong legs and a smile on my face�. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men�s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn�t help but laugh. �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. �At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3		3																					
443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																					
444	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 	1	1		1																					
448	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down� (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author�s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it."	1	2		2																					
450	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2		2																					
451	3	Don�t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say �the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don�t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1		1																					
455	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would�ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																					
460	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1		1																					
461	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 	1	1		1																					
465	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn�t sweat as much and wouldn�t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear�and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2	2		2																					
468	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
472	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2		2																					
477	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3		3																					
479	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn�t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn�t have water he couldn�t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																					
481	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don�t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that�s his problem.	2	2		2																					
483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2		2																					
485	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. �� I could drop from heatstroke�� he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. ��look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement�� It could have easily killed him, if he wasn�t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3		3																					
486	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn�t seen the land in a really long time. The man don�t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn�t know what to do.  	1	1		1																					
488	3	The cyclist in �Rough road Ahead� was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it�s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn�t an easy trick.	1	2		2																					
492	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him� no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen �One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of �the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.� That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																					
494	3	In the essay �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, �cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.�The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.�there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3		3																					
495	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
500	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn�t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3		3																					
501	3	I really thought the story didn�t make sense the setting was crazy I really wasn�t feeling it at all I don�t think it was even a good story	0	0		0																					
507	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, �I arrived at the first �Town��this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time�but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, �short, rolling hills� (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn�t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist�s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																					
509	3	In the selection �Do not exceed posted speed limit� there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn�t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and �crippling hills,� according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn�t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																					
511	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn�t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																					
513	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch�s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,� describes the cyclist, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the �shortcut.� �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,� reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, � By the looks of it- had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3		3																					
514	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist�s mood in a negative way.  	2	2		2																					
515	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,� At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																					
517	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay �A sea worry �, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says �my son body-surfs. He says it�s his �job�. That quote was explaining that he�s a body-surfer & it�s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																					
522	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																					
524	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers� This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.  	2	2		2																					
527	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche�s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.	3	3		3																					
529	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that �I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3	3		3																					
534	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can�t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can�t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn�t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																					
536	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
538	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn�t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the �high deserts of colifornia in June� I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a �ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back� That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to �ease post� it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was �replaced by short, rolling hills� which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																					
542	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are �cool pines and rushing rivers,� however, the cyclist comes to find that the �rushing river� is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he�d be better off using his map.	2	1		2																					
544	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.	2	2		2																					
548	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.�	1	1		1																					
549	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn�t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																					
557	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn�t that good. There�re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn�t have any energic to get up. There�re some interesting sence in the story.	2	2		2																					
560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don�t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.	0	0		0																					
562	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit� a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
563	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says ��and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�� @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ��ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 	2	2		2																					
564	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the �ramshackle shed� the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every �shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																					
566	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns � all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.	2	2		2																					
569	3	He�s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He�s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can�t find any towns that aren�t abandoned.	2	2		2																					
570	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1		1																					
575	3	"Many things about the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is �tarlike� and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn�t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
580	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said �� The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,�� As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																					
582	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven�t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don�t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don�t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
583	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.� This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																					
588	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the �town� The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp�� (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2		3																					
589	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. �The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.� he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. �At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back�bloked the majority of the pavement.� It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1		1																					
592	3	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says �The sun was beating down on me�. The author is hot From the sun. He says �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  	2	2		2																					
598	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,�Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,"	1	1		1																					
625	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
630	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can�t put anything back in your skin and your body can�t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn�t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2		2																					
639	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths.	2	1		2																					
643	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn�t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn�t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
644	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																					
645	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, �what I shouldn�t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,�"	1	1		1																					
652	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn�t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																					
654	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3	3		3																					
659	3	The setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...� this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.	2	2		2																					
661	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1		1																					
664	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, �Sometimes life can be so cruel�. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He�s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
666	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a �Short hit� leading to no where. �Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June� This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																					
668	3	because he was telling to make it wirte he nite to go and he much it because he was drieing to soil and because he was drieing 55 mph pert hour and 12 mph and sometime life can feel so cruel in life ya dig and that ia all I can said right now.	1	1		1																					
672	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																					
680	3	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The features in the story changed the speaker�s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber�s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2		2																					
681	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,� is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, �After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn�t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.� One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn�t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.� @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.	1	1		1																					
682	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,�The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I�d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.� This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn�t care if he died. From the author�s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
687	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over �one long, crippling hill.� From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you�re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.	2	2		2																					
692	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth He ride was fast when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town.	1	1		1																					
696	3	"In �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won�t make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.� This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn�t think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
700	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an �ramshackle shed� he became troubled , as he �had been �hitting� his �water bottles regularly� and was traveling through the �desert of California in June� and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he �manuevered� his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon �@CAPS1 and Wilber�s Fish Camp� and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																					
701	3	The features of the setting in the story �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn�t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting�s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																					
710	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.	1	1		1																					
729	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
739	3	The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.� is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.	1	1		1																					
741	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, �Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.	1	1		1																					
745	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																					
748	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like �battery acid� changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump �lodges are in his thro at� making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to �Gary and will fish camp� and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3	3		3																					
749	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1		2																					
752	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
758	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
759	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven�t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car.	1	1		1																					
761	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is �The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. �This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived. This story is a great story that shows determination and self control.	2	3		3																					
764	3	The setting affects the cyclist in alot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding  in @LOCATION1, it woudn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.	1	1		1																					
768	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
772	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states �This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.� This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
773	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he�s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2		2																					
779	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, �a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, �This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect"	2	3		3																					
785	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a � ridiculously large snake �crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,� hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  	3	2		3																					
796	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																					
798	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..� it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1		1																					
801	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' � abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																					
804	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren�t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamond back � blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
806	3	The cyclist run into a diamond headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere the thing I would do is find some rope or cord time old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people  that havent left their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
816	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�	1	1		1																					
823	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it�s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it�s hot because the speaker tells us how he�s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. �There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind� (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																					
827	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says �flat roads were replace by short rolling hills�, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,� the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says �no one in sight�, no building, car, or structure�, he is affected because he can�t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2		2																					
830	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1�s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist�s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																					
831	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral�� he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, �doing a water-deleting @NUM1.� The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, �ironic twist� the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																					
832	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.� In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says �the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. � When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, �I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage and that not to get too excited� the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to �burning sun� and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states �with only luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3	3		3																					
836	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn�t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, �tar like substance oozed out.� That makes him nevers and mad because he isn�t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
841	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads � I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. �@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He 	1	1		1																					
845	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																					
846	3	Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don�t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, �The sun was beginning to beat down� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1		3																					
851	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, �at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake �These roadblock would danger the biker, for he�d have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldn�t"	2	2		2																					
852	3	After reading �Do not Exceed Posted Limit� I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. �that mood� was replaced by short, moving hills.� The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, �@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.� There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																					
857	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don�t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
859	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there weren�t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
864	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,�and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																					
865	3	The features setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn�t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																					
867	3	Many features of the cyclist�s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It�s like he�s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won�t hit any thing. The fact that he�s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																					
874	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, �a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2		3																					
875	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships.	2	2		2																					
880	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn�t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																					
884	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is � I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.� I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  	3	2		3																					
890	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. �I checked my water supply and heated on� is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says �If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I�ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1		1																					
907	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, �and quickly realized that he shouldn�t have. The author describes the setting of the first �town� as, �the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This didn�t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule.� Was what met him there. The cyclist said that �this sight was troubling.� It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																					
910	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affected the cyclist in the story. �Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
918	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving � tarlike substance� said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the � ridiculously large snake� he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by �[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage,� Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																					
919	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, ""and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story""do not exceed the speed limit. "	3	2		3																					
923	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there. So I would listen to the cyclist & never ever listen to old men.	1	1		1																					
925	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from �old timers� the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that�s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn�t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn�t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn�t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3		3																					
929	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																					
934	3	The cyclist has to endure ruff treain and bad road condisions and a lack of water is the ??? near did not help the prodlem. Ther was a good prasority he could have heat strock then his hope was stll up by a abonded welches take factry.	1	1		1																					
935	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn�t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn�t have been so worried. What�s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn�t have struggled so much at the end. �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3																					
942	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  	1	1		1																					
948	3	The features of the setting affect. Any cyclist   because with the cyclist passed many time in the bicycle had problem on his/her back  when he/she will be older. When they will be a older person and they had passed many time in the bicycle, they will had a serious problems and also they will can not walk  more.	0	0		0																					
952	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."	2	2		2																					
955	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav�nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn�t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																					
957	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, �The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2		2																					
967	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1		1																					
973	3	The setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, �a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn�t cool down,� This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																					
984	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote �through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn�t even get any water. Like on the quote �of the rusted water pump.� it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
986	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  	1	1		1																					
989	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two �hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.	2	2		2																					
992	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. �The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.� These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. �I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.� He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																					
993	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist	1	1		1																					
1001	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit �the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office�. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn�t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																					
1003	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1		1																					
1004	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																					
1007	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1	1		1																					
1011	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states �ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated �I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June�� There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.	1	1		1																					
1015	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph� That site ment that the old man�s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																					
1016	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																					
1018	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1		1																					
1022	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.� This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2		2																					
1024	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																					
1033	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted �I toiledon� he sounds like it�s hopeless, that he wasn�t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1040	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�, California�s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 	2	3		3																					
1041	3	In the short story �Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,� The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in �the high deserts of California in June � .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3		3																					
1044	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0		0																					
1050	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. �... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																					
1053	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it�s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He�s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch�s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																					
1054	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .� The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,� In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it � had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2		3																					
1057	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1		1																					
1058	3	�There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. �I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																					
1063	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, �The sun was beginning to heat down� (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June� (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it�s warmer months. The terrain didn�t favor in the riders either �Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills �(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2		2																					
1065	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.	1	1		1																					
1081	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1090	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																					
1091	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can�t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1		1																					
1093	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, �@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!� Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																					
1095	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as �the high deserts of California in June.� He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."	3	3		3																					
1099	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he�s at risk of running out. Not only that but he�s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.� I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.� So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
1102	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was �going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch�s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
1106	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1		1																					
1108	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said � There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California.	2	2		2																					
1116	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left their porches since carter was in office.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers �shortcut� and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says �Yes, sir! I own a very good map,� and �I�d always stick to it in the future.� The cyclist�s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2		2																					
1117	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.	2	1		2																					
1119	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, �Things began well enough� flat roads�� This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a �smile on the face.� (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next �town�. Finally, when the author reaches �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp� he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, �know The best way to get There? �Yes sir! I own a very good map.� This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
1121	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn�t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																					
1125	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback� (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn�t there.	1	1		1																					
1131	3	The cyclist�s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through �the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states �Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    	3	3		3																					
1138	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit � the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1	1		1																					
1147	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists� brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists� travel much harder.	2	1		2																					
1149	3	"The setting of the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a �short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.� With this he arrives at the first �town� but hes wasn�t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.� This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3		3																					
1152	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike �through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. If it would have been @DATE1 and there was a nice breeze it would be different.	1	1		1																					
1154	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it�s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don�t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1		1																					
1156	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t let their porch since carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1158	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1161	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about �old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1		1																					
1166	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town �I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote means that he wasn�t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1		2																					
1168	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says �The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn�t even realize the heat.	1	1		1																					
1173	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn�t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.� They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted �I eased past.� When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist�s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other �GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we�re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1174	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, �I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3		3																					
1176	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1		1																					
1183	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn�t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn�t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2		2																					
1184	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won�t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn�t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that�s just unhealthy	2	2		2																					
1186	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist�s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant� which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																					
1188	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1		1																					
1191	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. �one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� It�s only him.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2		2																					
1192	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1198	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,� this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1205	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1207	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3	3		3																					
1217	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won�t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2	3		3																					
1222	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon �one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps� no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew �travelling through the high deserts of California in June� his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite� would be to devastating	1	2		2																					
1225	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
1230	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2		2																					
1236	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� @CAPS1 example is, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.	2	2		2																					
1240	3	he wouldn�t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike�s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can�t go any more he might give it up	1	1		1																					
1241	3	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.	1	1		1																					
1242	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3																					
1244	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn�t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.�� You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2		3																					
1247	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist�s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1		1																					
1248	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1253	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
1254	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says �and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
1256	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how �the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1		1																					
1258	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It also says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1259	3	"The cyclist�s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."	1	2		2																					
1264	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. �I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June� This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. �This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware. She had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story.   "	3	2		3																					
1277	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also it�s hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. throught the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up sarving	1	1		1																					
1285	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an �Ghost town� with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2		2																					
1286	3	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.	2	2		2																					
1289	3	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1	1		1																					
1291	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, �over one long crippling hill, a building came into view� This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn�t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don�t make a life-threating choice.	3	2		3																					
1296	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!� The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.	2	2		2																					
1313	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he�s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2		2																					
1318	3	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1320	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey."	3	3		3																					
1321	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states �This sight was troubleing,� He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water�. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3		3

1325	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1328	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn�t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3		3																					
1338	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says �the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule.� He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the �overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.� This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3	3		3																					
1345	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, �It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful.	2	2		2																					
1346	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him.

1348	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to.	1	1		1																					
1352	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. �high deserats of California in June �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2		2																					
1354	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn�t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.	3	3		3																					
1356	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don�t help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn�t have any energy left after all of that he wouldn�t have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2		2																					
1357	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn�t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn�t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn�t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can�t get energy, so he can�t ride the bike.	1	1		1																					
1359	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
1371	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,� that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2	2		2																					
1373	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump �black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2		3																					
1374	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� starts off in the �serenity of an easly summer evening� taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn�t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his �short cut� was not so short after all. The �high deserts of California in June� and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he�d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.� @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  	3	3		3																					
1383	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can�t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn�t ask for directions. So the lession is don�t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3	2		3																					
1385	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he�s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, �yes- sir: I own a very good map.� @CAPS2 by this he�s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he�ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2		3																					
1387	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like �flat road� and �short, rolling hills�, There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1388	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that�s what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them�(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.	1	1		1																					
1396	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don�t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn�t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2		2																					
1400	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he�d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3		3																					
1407	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved	2	2		2																					
1418	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only �    eighteen miles down the road.� He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he �conserved his water ...� and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1		1																					
1427	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because he�s going to Yosemite national park and he�d gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs,� Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch�s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man�s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1		1																					
1428	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn�t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �This statement proves that the cyclist wasn�t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren�t there, but you want to see those things. � I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �It was a good decision that the cyclist didn�t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2		2																					
1430	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.	1	1		1																					
1433	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1		1																					
1434	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. �Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�.�. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can�t play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.	3	2		3																					
1437	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldn�t go as fast, �The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down.� @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2		2																					
1447	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as �the high deserts of California.� The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1451	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1		1																					
1465	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
1466	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2																					
1468	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. �I hung my head,� means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.	2	2		2																					
1478	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.	1	1		1																					
1479	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day� This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear� This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn�t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.	2	2		2																					
1482	3	Throughout �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake...�  (Kurmaskie @NUM1).The cyclist fared land blockings and dangerous animals. This cause him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely not out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June.The speaker stated, �@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expirencing the high temperatures of the setting. The cyclist witnessed the intense  features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1486	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1487	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn�t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2		2																					
1489	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it�s a sad story and it�s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That�s how the setting makes it better.	1	1		1																					
1492	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1493	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. "	2	2		2																					
1494	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said �This place might have been a thriving little spot� but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.� He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. �I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.� He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.	2	2		2																					
1502	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1		1																					
1503	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� For example, he finds a �ramshackle shed� and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1		1																					
1505	3	Pride, determination, relief � all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, �a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.� After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, �I gathered � a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.� This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, �As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2	3		3																					
1508	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1510	3	The cyclist traked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Trakling through the first town the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps and corral lotated in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept hope and traveled to the next town. Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. �I was going to die,� he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it�s the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe. The features effects his attitude because in a baren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what�s around us affect us as in education, friendship, and survival.	2	2		2																					
1512	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.	2	2		2																					
1514	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1		1																					
1515	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.	1	1		1																					
1517	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1		1																					
1518	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, �Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven�t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.� This affecting the setting because if it weren�t for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.	1	1		1																					
1536	3	When your doing any sport or any thing were you sweat your setting is everything. If your sweating in a setting you can easily get sick. The setting from the story Rough road ahead the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot. Thats why the cyclist was tired and sick because he was sweating and had no water. Thats how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1539	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, �no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,� he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to �short, rolling hills�. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed �crippling�, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3		3																					
1550	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That�s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That�s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1552	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run�down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3		3																					
1553	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. @NUM1 way is the condition of roads. Another is the heat. Another is snakes. Another is no town insight. The final one is lack of info. @MONTH1 be the guy made it. @MONTH1 be he got hurt on the ride.  Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.   	1	1		1																					
1559	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it�s only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would�ve been no one there to help.	2	2		2																					
1566	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next �town� and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch�s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming �the birds will pick me clean,� To the cyclist also was best, then he was �saved� by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3		3																					
1568	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, �the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1570	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and mear death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his distination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people.	1	1		1																					
1574	3	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasn�t up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction.	2	2		2																					
1580	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� If something were there, he wouldn�t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2		2																					
1584	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.	1	1		1																					
1589	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2		3																					
1596	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states �I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view�. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist�s trip and how it affected her.	3	3		3																					
1602	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. �Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.� This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
1603	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn�t even no where he was goin.	1	1		1																					
1605	3	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.	1	1		1																					
1608	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, �came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn�t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.� Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals."	3	3		3																					
1611	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see�s the sign that says, �Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.� So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1		1																					
1612	3	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
1613	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn�t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
1616	3	"The features of the setting in the essay �Rough Road Ahead.� affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently, on his journey after following �their advice�, reasoning that the men sounded �no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with then mention of tumble weeds,� and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path in the end the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and follow his own map from then on."	2	2		2																					
1623	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3		3																					
1626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn�t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1		1																					
1628	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.	1	2		2																					
1629	3	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don�t have to worry about getting hit so you�ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  	1	1		1																					
1631	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat� when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he �drank deeply from the sink.� The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1632	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1635	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It�s just an overall way setting to give lost in.	1	1		1																					
1640	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.� He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, �Summertime �rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain�. It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song �summertime� He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1647	3	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  �text states � two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing�	1	1		1																					
1653	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l�D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven�t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.	3	2		3																					
1662	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1663	3	The location of a cyclist�s ride affects the person�s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked �brackish.� So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1665	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a �shortcut� but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
1666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0		0																					
1667	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled � I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. � This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said � if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.�  	2	1		2																					
1670	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1671	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1673	3	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ,� tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 her example would be when they said� Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1674	3	"The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot "" The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening"" to cycling."	1	1		1																					
1682	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2	2		2																					
1683	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. �The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances	2	1		2																					
1687	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, �The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water�� He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn�t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3		3																					
1691	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That�s basically what the setting is about.	3	2		3																					
1702	3	In the essay, �Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.	2	3		3																					
1708	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
1709	3	Weather, places, the will to continue � all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal. The sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride.  I mean come on who wants to ride when its burning hot outside the places the cyclist went through like towns and rough roads would affect him because it�s pretty tough.	1	2		2																					
1714	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven�t left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn�t any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a	2	2		2																					
1718	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. �Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. �Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me� This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3		3																					
1721	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the �� high   deserts of California� �   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   �� long, crippling hill� � (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
1727	4	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she�ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn�t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    	0	0		0																					
1735	4	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.	1	1		1																					
1738	4	I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.	0	0		0																					
1746	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home	1	1		1																					
1747	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.	1	1		1																					
1748	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
1756	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen.	1	1		1																					
1763	4	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she�s happy now. So she�s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she�s to do all over again.	0	0		0																					
1771	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
1784	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0		0																					
1788	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country�s home without crying. ""It�s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
1790	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
1791	4	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.  	0	0		0																					
1795	4	The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, �then I will take that test again�. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time.	2	3		3																					
1801	4	"The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can�t garden do to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. 'The, author is just saying saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather is gone Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said �I will take the test again"" saeng.  Meaning saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her starts to grow again."	1	1		1																					
1802	4	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom	1	1		1																					
1803	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the � Winter Hibiscus� has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.	3	2		3																					
1807	4	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.	1	1		1																					
1809	4	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it�s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.	2	2		2																					
1810	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng�s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.	3	2		3																					
1818	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says �when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story �Winter Hibiscus� used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."	3	2		3																					
1834	4	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing �now.� The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.	1	1		1																					
1839	4	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.	0	0		0																					
1841	4	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at-at- ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. ""Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test."	1	2		2																					
1849	4	The auther concludes the story with, �when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the auther used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own. Or he could write another story to finish it. Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending.	1	1		1																					
1856	4	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that�s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
1867	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus�chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, �I will take that test again�. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""�when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...� @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start"	2	2		2																					
1868	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won�t give up. �Saeng  vowed silently to herself, �I will take that test again�, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3		3																					
1869	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
1874	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1		1																					
1879	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
1882	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.	2	1		2																					
1888	4	I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus.	1	1		1																					
1889	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1		1																					
1890	4	The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesn�t mean your going to fail again. Also it�s okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.	2	1		2																					
1894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0		0																					
1905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.	0	0		0																					
1906	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now.� This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   	2	2		2																					
1907	4	The last paragraph states �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2		2																					
1912	4	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.	0	0		0																					
1917	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything�s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it�s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1919	4	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she�s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don�t think she really needs it. I guess it just �comforts� her.	1	1		1																					
1924	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus � Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. �Almost  familiar to her now.� This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.	2	3		3																					
1928	4	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again�. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."	1	1		1																					
1931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there�s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. Finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.	1	1		1																					
1933	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn�t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding� The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn�t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.	3	2		3																					
1941	4	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it�s bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says �in the spring����.I will take this test again�. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.	1	1		1																					
1946	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2		2																					
1950	4	So she did not forget to take the test again.	0	1		1																					
1951	4	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That�s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
1960	4	  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again� because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It�s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.	2	2		2																					
1961	4	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better as time goes on. Saeng failed the driver�s test because she wasnt ready. The flower bloomed before it was ready. The author is saying you need to be patient and good things will come your way	1	1		1																					
1963	4	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down.	1	1		1																					
1964	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.	1	1		1																					
1965	4	In the short story �Winter hibiscus� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as thought Saeng would be ready to take thee test at that particular time.	1	1		1																					
1973	4	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring & the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die	0	0		0																					
1976	4	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, �Here let me help you mother.� This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, �almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.� This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn�t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement.	1	2		2																					
1982	4	"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."	2	2		2																					
1989	4	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didn�t finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well written story and conclusion.  	1	1		1																					
1996	4	The last paragraph of the �Winter Hibiscus� reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees �plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. �The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails �the test� by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is �almost familiar to her now,� such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.	2	2		2																					
1997	4	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. �the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is �strong enough to make it through the cold months that�s what matters.� This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming �familiar�. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it�s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   	3	3		3																					
2000	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of  winter.	0	0		0																					
2004	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin"" she means that she will not give up at all."	1	1		1																					
2012	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author uses the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went� It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn�t pass her test she doesn�t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2		2																					
2029	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society.	2	2		2																					
2030	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. �In the story it says, �When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub� This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:� �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "	3	3		3																					
2040	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement.	1	1		1																					
2050	4	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she�s going to try to retake the test next spring.	2	1		2																					
2051	4	The author concludes the story with, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It�s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.	2	3		3																					
2054	4	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she going to try again. When I was reading this story it�s says in the story that her mother had asked her �What happened.� And the Saeng said �I- I failed the test�. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts and Saeng vowed to herself that this time she work harder and past the test.	1	1		1																					
2058	4	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother�s money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2059	4	"The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life."	1	1		1																					
2061	4	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story �Winter Hibiscus� on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They�ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, �why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags� which is the mother�s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. �Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.� She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.	2	2		2																					
2065	4	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. �The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin."	0	0		0																					
2067	4	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.	2	1		2																					
2078	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2		2																					
2082	4	In the story �winter hibiscus �by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says �I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ��in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again.	2	2		2																					
2085	4	 The author concludes the story with the sentence, ��when they come back  Saeng  vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again��. The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes  Saeng has had to go through. The two major ones in this story were moving to a new placThe author concludes the story with the sentence, ��When they come back Saeng vowed silently to her self in the spring,when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,then I will take that test again.The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes Saeng has had to go through.The two major ones in this story were moving to a new place,and failing her ariving test.Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others.So I think this  sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going to be ok, and overcome everything that happened.Know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future proplems.       e, and failing her ariving test. Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. so I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going  to be ok, and overcome everything that happened know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future problems.     	2	2		2																					
2092	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says �but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.	2	2		2																					
2098	4	The author ended that story like that because that�s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.	1	1		1																					
2115	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because is the ron faldse in love with the plant and uses for a clock to tell her when she can take the test. It your not a @CAPS1.S citizen you can only take the driver�s test once a year.	1	1		1																					
2120	4	Determination, help, strength � all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she�ll go back and she�ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she�ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2		3																					
2122	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn�t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2		2																					
2125	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
2130	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.	1	1		1																					
2134	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted her  new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the leader her last thoughts. So its like its, the  last thing , and subject  that  you  that  you  think  the author  concludes  the  story with  this  paragraph ,� when  they  come  back , in the spring , when the snows melt and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus is budding , then  I  will  take that  test  again.�	1	1		1																					
2136	4	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saeng�s mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.	0	0		0																					
2137	4	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.	2	1		2																					
2138	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1		1																					
2149	4	The concludes the story way because that the way he want for the gril to end it. Cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. She likes Madagascar periwinhle. The places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers.	0	0		0																					
2155	4	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  	3	3		3																					
2156	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, �one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.� This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, �she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.� This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.	0	0		0																					
2159	4	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she�ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.	1	1		1																					
2164	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng�s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver�s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, �[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, �She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become�almost familiar to her now.� Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  	3	3		3																					
2166	4	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.	1	1		1																					
2167	4	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.	2	3		3																					
2173	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, ends by, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start.	1	1		1																					
2177	4	This paragraph @NUM1 includes to let the reader know it's winter. you know its winter because in the passage its says when the snow melt.	0	0		0																					
2179	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn�t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she�ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She�ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow� s done melting, and when she�s done crying like the snow�s done melting, and when she�s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she�ll be ready to take the test.	3	2		3																					
2180	4	All throughout the story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng�s future and growing confidence.	2	2		2																					
2183	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2184	4	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.	1	1		1																					
2189	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she�ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2205	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has �tear stains and puffy eyes� as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
2211	4	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.	1	1		1																					
2212	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test.	0	0		0																					
2224	4	In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states � its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus�. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.	2	2		2																					
2225	4	The concluding paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus �portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring . this is obvious shown it states  �in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh , and then try to pass the test. The change from winter  to spring symbolize saeng�s hardship  of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese   return and the hibiscus is  adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which saeng  follows as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now  also prosper elsewhere. 	3	2		3																					
2228	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants she�s seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how they�re adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn�t necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.	2	3		3																					
2230	4	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test �in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,� it�s inspiring to know that she�ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise� to take that test again� can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for �when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming � when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. 	3	2		3																					
2233	4	"In the story ��winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.�� @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."	0	0		0																					
2235	4	Saeng did get the feel that she called fil in and. Buying something that could help her but also have her missing were she from. And with her mother get a little mad about it because the prags she pay for. It @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself in the spring that she take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2238	4	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.	2	1		2																					
2240	4	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won�t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it�s not quite as cold.	1	1		1																					
2242	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.	2	1		2																					
2247	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 	1	1		1																					
2248	4	"The author concludes this story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future."	1	1		1																					
2249	4	The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.	1	2		2																					
2252	4	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.� The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why �and the geese return.� is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you �plant� yourself you can thrive with confidence. "	2	3		3																					
2253	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn�t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won�t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2264	4	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, �This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.	2	3		3																					
2271	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn�t ready, and she didn�t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.	0	0		0																					
2274	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It�s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.	0	0		0																					
2275	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it�s telling how Saeng  feel about winter being near and how she have to wale  until spring come back around to do her teast again.  	1	1		1																					
2279	4	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. 	2	3		3																					
2280	4	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,� In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .� mean that when all is @CAPS1 .� She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don�t even know what she  failed  so I didn�t  like it.	1	1		1																					
2286	4	The author of � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,� because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the �Winter  Hibiscus� Saeng, �realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and �Winter Hibiscus�. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. �The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.� The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   	3	3		3																					
2287	4	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn�t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.	0	0		0																					
2289	4	In �winter Hibiscus� the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.	2	2		2																					
2296	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
2301	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn�t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn�t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.	1	2		2																					
2302	4	I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� said �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.� to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn�t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1		1																					
2304	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test �when the snow melts and the geese return.� I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver�s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author�s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver�s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  	3	3		3																					
2314	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn�t give up."	1	2		2																					
2317	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.	0	0		0																					
2323	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.	1	1		1																					
2327	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for �Dok Faeng-noi which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, �As Saeng walks home after failing her driver�s test, she sees a familiar plant.� The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. �@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.� Dok faeng-nor� she said. �where did you get it.� That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all saeng went through her mother was glad she bought it. �It�s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi,� she finally said. �I�m glad you got it.�	1	1		1																					
2330	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver�s test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time 	1	1		1																					
2333	4	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it more clearer so the readers would understand It more. And so he could, make it better to stand out. 	0	0		0																					
2336	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better.	1	1		1																					
2348	4	Saeng would return to her homeland.	0	0		0																					
2360	4	I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 he realy liked it.	0	0		0																					
2365	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng�s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test.	2	2		2																					
2371	4	They author must have put this in the story to show change. For all giving things is we give we do e them we replemise the author. People dont think about the small damages, there nuste comrade with the big changes. The small ones count the turnig sioteero & I have to bind as for. On top of that the old anges to drive.

2373	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes, and wraps up the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adapting, and how this all calmed her down after failing the test.	1	1		1																					
2374	4	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.	0	0		0																					
2382	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the �test� again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.	1	1		1																					
2396	4	The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,��when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are �renewed� in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.	2	3		3																					
2397	4	he concludes the sTory  with his paRagRaph because he wanted To say That he was going To Take The Test again when it was not The winTeR @CAPS1 and show how saeng vowed to heRself By saying that he oR she will take The Test again when it is not winTeR because even @CAPS2 the Test was not passed in winteR and could have been passed duRing when TheRe snow melted in the gRound	1	1		1																					
2403	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver�s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																					
2406	4	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. And what the area is like weather wise.	0	0		0																					
2410	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn�t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that�s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																					
2413	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human�izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2		3																					
2416	4	"The @CAPS1 why the authoR concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRselF, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese REtuRn and this bibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The authoR ended it like that, because Saeng basically saying time will come FoR heR  to take that test and she will past it with belieF in heRselF,"	1	1		1																					
2420	4	"I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, �because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return� the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance�. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again�, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																					
2423	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ��in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																					
2432	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																					
2437	4	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.	1	1		1

2441	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect.	0	0		0																					
2446	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is �almost familiar to her now� (@NUM1).	1	2		2																					
2447	4	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.	1	1		1																					
2449	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, �I failed the test,� (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																					
2452	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author�s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2456	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time �when the shows me�. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, �Saeng  brokedown and wept!� The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the �show will melt� and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as �yet another old friend�. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3		3																					
2458	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn�t want us to forget the reason she walked home. It would have never happened.	1	1		1																					
2459	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng�s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
2460	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,� then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2		2																					
2461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says � saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																					
2463	4	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn�t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time	0	0		0																					
2466	4	"The author�s conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again"", what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. Thats what I got from the conclusion. "	1	1		1																					
2467	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																					
2470	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,�� I think Saeng�s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she�s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn�t going to give up and she�ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it�s hard to adjust to changes to life�s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she�ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3		3																					
2471	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph �when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2472	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																					
2476	4	Because she was promiseing herself that when spring comes back then she will take the drivers test agin.	1	1		1																					
2480	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver�s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, �aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her. �Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. �The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng�s mouth watered,�, �The winter hibiscus� was in the ground now�, and, �overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and � yes � Familiar to Saeng now.� This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng�s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. 	3	3		3																					
2495	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver�s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																					
2498	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1		2																					
2500	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn�t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don�t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don�t want to, it doesn�t mean you can�t go on.	1	2		2																					
2502	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																					
2503	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																					
2505	4	The author ends the story with  �When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. � A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her.� She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      	2	2		2																					
2506	4	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it�s the end of the story so it�s a good way to end it because it�s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it�s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It�s not like most endings to a story so it�s unique. Because most stories aren�t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2508	4	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.	0	0		0																					
2513	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don�t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2514	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,� I I failed the test,� meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She�s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,�saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,� meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.      	0	0		0																					
2522	4	"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says �When they come back,� so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when �the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When �this hibiscus is budding,� so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will �take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																					
2533	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -� when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. �Its� flower arn�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.� (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. �like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.� (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don�t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don�t be afraid to try again.	2	2		2																					
2537	4	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that�s tuff. 	1	1		1																					
2541	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it�s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.	1	1		1																					
2543	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn�t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.	2	2		2																					
2554	4	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens	1	1		1																					
2556	4	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don�t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.	0	0		0																					
2558	4	The author includes  this sentence in  the paragraph  because  it�s  the  start  of  a  new  beginning.	1	1		1																					
2561	4	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was �Madagascar periwinkle� in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower�s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.	2	2		2																					
2562	4	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I�I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line	1	1		1																					
2563	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  	2	2		2																					
2564	4	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.	0	0		0																					
2566	4	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.	1	2		2																					
2569	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, �in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author�s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																					
2585	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says �let me help mother.� This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng�s commitment.	2	3		3																					
2587	4	The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with the passage �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																					
2590	4	"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains the way her culture is depending on the theme of the story."	1	1		1																					
2591	4	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story �Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.	2	2		2																					
2592	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says �she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																					
2593	4	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.	1	1		1																					
2600	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home � In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.	1	2		2																					
2602	4	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the �winter hibiscus� reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver�s test again in the spring. 	2	3		3																					
2603	4	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.	1	1		1																					
2605	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng�s situation is similar to the flower�s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3		3																					
2616	4	Saeng promises herself that  �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.� The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, �that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																					
2617	4	So she saying she will take the test next year.	1	1		1																					
2621	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself �I will take that test again,� shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng�s good character. It shows Saeng�s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	2		2																					
2622	4	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."	2	2		2																					
2623	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again."	2	2		2																					
2634	4	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.	1	1		1																					
2637	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 	1	1		1																					
2647	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																					
2652	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the �Winter hibiscus� had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn�t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  	3	2		3																					
2654	4	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk�s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author	1	1		1																					
2664	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that�s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.."	1	1		1																					
2671	4	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn�t past the test. I fell she met that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.	1	1		1																					
2674	4	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2678	4	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she�s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland	1	1		1																					
2680	4	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to snow that Saeng  will be of next year . She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that .	2	2		2																					
2682	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�by Minfong Ho,the author  decided  to  end  it  with  the  sentence   �when they come back, Saeng  vowed  silently  to herself,  in   the  spring. When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the  determination  all  living  things  have  to  succeed at their main purpose. .The  flower  drivers  to re-bud. The  geese  drive  at  coming back  again  during  the  spring and the main character  drives  at  passing  the  test.The author of �Winter Hibiscus,�Minfong Ho,put that quote as the last  line of  the  story  for  inspiration.To  inspire  people  to  continue  the  path of life and if  you fail are task,try again.So the author gives you inspiration to help you continue to live your life	3	3		3																					
2688	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line �I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote �I failed the test� with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																					
2693	4	The author ends the story with �when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2694	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. �The �winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. �Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.� When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																					
2701	4	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2702	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had �failed her driving test �.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   	2	3		3																					
2707	4	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A �TEST� OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN."	1	2		2																					
2712	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																					
2716	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver�s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																					
2737	4	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test and because of her love of the hibiscus plant spring will help her take test.	1	1		1																					
2748	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.	0	0		0																					
2751	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
2755	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2757	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2759	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.What I mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.She says �When the hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.This will be a new start for her  .The plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.She�s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant.	2	2		2																					
2767	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.	2	1		2																					
2771	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2776	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0		0																					
2777	4	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.	0	0		0																					
2780	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng�s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles �seem so much more beautiful	2	3		3																					
2784	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
2791	4	she said it because she didn�t do what she was sopose to so she said she failed her mother was mad for a second but then stopped she said I love it and asked if she wanted something to eat so the went inside but she took the task as a test so she said next time I will do it right.	1	1		1																					
2795	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver�s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																					
2796	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																					
2798	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it�s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, �It�s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng�s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, �not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert� (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2802	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																					
2804	4	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don�t know how good you have it.  	0	0		0																					
2810	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2																					
2818	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn�t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end �Winter Hibiscus�, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2819	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3		3																					
2821	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
2822	4	The final  paragraph in, �winter  hibiscus �by @CAPS1  Ho reads  � When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.�This paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home	2	2		2																					
2825	4	The last line is included in the story �Winter Hibiscus� because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																					
2830	4	"The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. Itis ended On a note of rebirth and second chances. when Saeng vows,� when the come back, inthe spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,"" The author is connecting a sense oF a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. this is connected to saengs second chance.The author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. Itshows that thereis some hope for her test. "	2	2		2																					
2832	4	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom	1	0		1																					
2833	4	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother�s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in �a blink.� Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.	1	1		1																					
2840	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																					
2842	4	 In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her � gentle grandmother� from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story �Winter Hibiscus � with the paragraph selected.	3	2		3																					
2851	4	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saeng�s success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saeng�s determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.	1	1		1																					
2852	4	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.	2	3		3																					
2858	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2862	4	NO IMAGE	1	1		1																					
2864	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
2867	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																					
2873	4	The author ends the story by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother �noticed the tear staie on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes.� Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 	2	1		2																					
2879	4	The author concludes the story like this @CAPS2 the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I @CAPS1 this @CAPS2 the text say's Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again. This means that in spring the hibiscus will @CAPS3.	0	0		0																					
2885	4	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won�t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.	1	1		1																					
2889	4	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter."	1	1		1																					
2895	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.	2	1		2																					
2898	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, ""who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again."	1	2		2																					
2910	4	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that�s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.	0	0		0																					
2919	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don�t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn�t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says �when they come back then I will take the test again,� that�s showing she isn�t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.	1	1		1																					
2934	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1		1																					
2935	4	"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."	1	1		1																					
2936	4	"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. �There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, "" "" "" �floating in the bucket.� Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.� Spring is a time for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the �getting-ready� stage."	2	2		2																					
2938	4	I�ll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book.	0	0		0																					
2940	4	The author of ,�Winter Hibiscus ,� concludes the story with the paragraph,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .�The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1		1																					
2946	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn�t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote �in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2950	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2953	4	�If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again.� This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng�s situation in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus.� Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.� This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																					
2958	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. �It�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled. �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. �But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive�s test one more try. �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																					
2965	4	"The auther includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that she seils brought back her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that rich scent"" (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples �It felt smooth and cool� (paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of to childhood's plan is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. she come back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways think that is why the author adds that at the end."	1	1		1																					
2971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																					
2976	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test whe n she knows that she will past the test so she can get her licesned. Saeng wants her licesned so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again.	1	1		1																					
2981	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS �THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.�, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.	2	1		2																					
2988	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It�s-it�s not a real one, �Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.� One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. �Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.� The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.� Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																					
2989	4	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn�t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.	1	1		1																					
2996	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																					
3002	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It�s almost as though it�s taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words �at home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2		2																					
3004	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																					
3006	4	She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.	1	1		1																					
3010	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won�t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal.	1	2		2																					
3011	4	"In the stoRy �WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, �then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2		2																					
3013	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."	2	1		2																					
3016	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. She puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons. One reason is that we know she wont give up. In the story she says �Then I will take the test again.� It tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so. Another reason is that she�s trying to tell us that there is a future for the hibiscus. How is when she says ��and this hibiscus is budding,� that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get use to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. Last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says �she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange�, almost familiar to her now,� @CAPS1 trying to get use to her surroundings and now realizes she can. In the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph. She gives examples in the story that makes many people get many	3	2		3																					
3025	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn�t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2		2																					
3036	4	Why did the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Is so he can right another story budding on vowed silently and he will right the. Story in the spring when they come back	0	0		0																					
3037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was saying that if it is possible for these things to happen then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things together that she knew that do noot go together. For example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over. She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn�t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn�t know to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country . All she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test .	2	2		2																					
3042	4	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus but she was still upset that they were�nt the real ones back at home. Her mother said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. when they come back  Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
3044	4	The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won�t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with �when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again.	2	1		2																					
3045	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3050	4	The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. �But how could you? You know how much we�what happened?� when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother�s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.	2	2		2																					
3051	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3052	4	The author concludes the story with this Paragraph because so you can get a view of what she is saying and also so you can understand it from her situration she was growing up like for example she said that	0	0		0																					
3054	4	In the story �Winter @CAPS1� the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say�s �It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0		0																					
3066	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,� to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																					
3071	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it	1	1		1																					
3077	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																					
3079	4	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3087	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authorconcludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in herlife but nothing is working out for her.""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again.""@CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing, '''the root-bound represents Saeng inher new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but assoon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life."	3	3		3																					
3098	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																					
3099	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1																					
3101	4	He ends the paragraph with this cause he is meaning to say he would rather take the test again when it is beautiful out in conclusion this is why I think The author ends it with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
3103	4	She say cloning the spring I will take the test again because she know if she failed the test againg her mother will be disappointed of her because she not trying hard enough or maybe them too him never be closer again. The mother think jst because she keep failing the test because of her connection to her past expeirences or effection for her new country. and ability to overcome obstacles ar finally I think she is comforted by memories or her homland..	1	1		1																					
3105	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, �I will take the test again.� In the story Saeng said, �I failed the test� but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
3108	4	The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her home land. Saeng said that she would take her drivers test again when her plant bloomed. The plant wos a reamder of her home I and and what she come from. The plant to Saeng was a form of confidance. Saeng went through handtimes and the plant wos close to her because it wos from her home land.	2	1		2																					
3109	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word �test�, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
3111	4	She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.	0	0		0																					
3112	4	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.	1	1		1																					
3114	4	It shows the importance of the  Hibiscus to Saeng and her dedication to the flower. It is also stating that she will wait for next spring to admire the flower again.	0	0		0																					
3119	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph the author is saying that Saeng will not quit until she pass that test she try and try and till she die. The author refering to the story again.	1	1		1																					
3124	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn�t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,� is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won�t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng�s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. This conclusion show how Saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3126	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a �V� and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it�s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it�s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3130	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus,� Minfong Ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. It is a time of renewed. Saeng �Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, �Then I will take that test again.� In the word choice of �That test again� depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, her test.     """	2	2		2																					
3136	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying �when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its � it�s not a real one. I mean, it�s not like the kind we had at � at � she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won�t give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her "	2	2		2																					
3138	4	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers �long gray hair, freshly washed �� But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again.	1	2		2																					
3141	4	I thank he uses it because she wants to get a nother one next year to see what its like to like something so much and get to look after it for a wial That is why I think the nararator use that phrase as his last one.	0	0		0																					
3143	4	The purpose for the ending the Author @CAPS1 is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng A good sense of comfort, compared to how:- she was At the beginning of the story. It Was like she had very little confidence. And now she is forced to call this strange place home, And that emptied her @CAPS2 to strive until she see�s A very familiar face that brings back her memories of when She was the happiest. Having something Around that was special to her Around All the time can make @CAPS3 feel At home or like it use to be, she found her confort in the Hibiscus. So now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through All the seasons, She will to with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories.	2	3		3																					
3146	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This paragraph ending shows that saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vowe top herself successful.	1	1		1																					
3151	4	The author used the concludes with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She wrights that because when her flower starts budding she will be able to take the test cause she is like a flower. The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3154	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said �then I will take that test again.� Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3157	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� probably chose to end the story that way because then it�s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																					
3166	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.	2	2		2																					
3168	4	The girl is determend to win. She wen�t and took a test for a flower and she did not pass and she went back sad and emoshond she told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at-at she cold not say at home because it took too much pain and her grandmother said they are not like the real wones.	1	1		1																					
3169	4	In this story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she�ll be better prepared. 	1	1		1																					
3170	4	The author would conclude the essay like he did because it sounded good to help he all the shangling ideas together. For example one person said, �she silently vowed to herself in the spring after the snow melts she would retake that test.   	0	0		0																					
3174	4	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.	1	1		1																					
3175	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3179	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.� I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. 	2	3		3																					
3186	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. �it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.� This expresses that the rememberence of �an old friend� was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. �she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter�s cheecks and her puffy eyes.� Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her �winter� hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																					
3189	4	Saeng will take the test in the spring when it�s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. 	1	1		1																					
3190	4	These are many reason why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3192	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3195	4	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic  loss  in  family  and also  a move  to  a totally different  world. The paragraph  is  symbolic  of  turning over a new leaf and starting over.The �snows  melting� and �hibiscus bidding� are both symbolizing  new life.Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept  her situation to  make  the  best  of  it. Also, the  author say �the  winter  hibiscus  was  in the ground now� as  it does compare to saengs new found  outlook  planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom.	2	2		2																					
3200	4	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.	1	1		1																					
3204	4	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come	1	1		1																					
3209	4	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.�  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																					
3214	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants don�t die during next @DATE1.	0	0		0																					
3218	4	The author is talking about gardning and how she wants to get better at in the spring. She probably thinks shes bad at gardening because her mom is really good at it and she wants to be that good at gardening too.	0	0		0																					
3221	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.	1	1		1																					
3222	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3228	4	The author ends the story with this because she is saying she will be around next year to take the test again. She is saying how she wants to be around when the plants grow. She mostly wants to see the hibiscus grow. Because she appreciates and likes nature so much she wants to be around again to see them grow.	0	0		0																					
3237	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     	1	1		1																					
3240	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																					
3241	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she�ll be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past.	1	2		2																					
3246	4	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
3251	4	The author concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. �The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the story�s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.	2	3		3																					
3253	4	I think he means thas seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. 	0	0		0																					
3256	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. 	2	3		3																					
3257	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																					
3258	4	The author ended the story �Winter Hibiscus� with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.	2	1		2																					
3269	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng�s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace.	1	2		2																					
3270	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she�ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that �many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.� And when she�s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  	3	3		3																					
3272	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like say most of the story but in a small and shorter way.	0	0		0																					
3280	4	�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now �out of the box,� and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and �failed her test.� The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  	3	2		3																					
3281	4	"The author concludes as the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" mean that she will take the test and hoped she pass so she could make her mother happy and support her. She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. "	1	1		1																					
3287	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...� the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. �Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.� The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �@CAPS1, Saeng said.� �After failing her driver�s test, walking into the florist�s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  	3	3		3																					
3296	4	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants the emphasize that the girl is not completly dissatisified with leaving her home. He ended with that because he wanted to she that their is hope for her to learn to love her new home.	1	1		1																					
3299	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
3300	4	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life.	1	1		1																					
3303	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																					
3307	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back� and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
3310	4	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver�s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the �winter hibiscus� represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will �plant a new seed.� The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng�s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.	2	2		2																					
3314	4	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. �Here let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe sh is a great gardener like her mother."	0	0		0																					
3317	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
3333	4	In the story , �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she�ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test.	3	3		3																					
3337	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author conclude the story with that special paragraph in order to mutul Saeng�s game for wanting to be home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wishes that she way in her homeland, and keeps up reffiring to it because she wants it back. �I mean, it�s not like the one we had at-at-,� Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn�t wish to mention home because it brought her to tears. In addition, were she mentions the �test�, it makes to her buyin a fake test.�It�s - it�s not a real one�. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test reffs to both the plant and the driver�s test. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represent hope to her, ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test�. The emotions test of both of the situations she is is will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end."	3	3		3																					
3342	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng�s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn�t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																					
3343	4	The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample �But it�s strong enough to make it through winter�, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself �Then i will take the test again.�     	2	2		2																					
3344	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0		0																					
3348	4	Then author put the last sentence the way it did. It mean't by that next spring they want to see how they react different of the same. They know what it is like but they know how to react to the season.	0	0		0																					
3350	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That�s why I think they ened with that pargraph	1	1		1																					
3362	4	The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng�s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is �strong enough to make ith through the cold months here� that is what matters,� this makes a connection between the plant and the author�s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she�ll wait until spring to take the test again.   	3	2		3																					
3365	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won�t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng�s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she�s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she�s growing along with the plant. 	2	1		2																					
3371	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will �bud� too and gain her license.	1	1		1																					
3378	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1		2																					
3380	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng�s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says �vowed� to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� familiar.� The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																					
3381	4	In the story, �winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home.	2	1		2																					
3383	4	The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 	1	2		2																					
3385	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1		2																					
3387	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																					
3392	4	I think he put this in here because. I think he�s trying to say when the snow melts just forget bout the first time. And when the geese return it your @NUM1 chance. Then the hibiscus budding is you get passed what you were trying to do.	1	1		1																					
3393	4	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both where talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1 so it sated when snows melt as it talkes about weather or the @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3400	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, �Winter Hibiscus,� in the way that she did. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here�� is what Saeng�s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states ��she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become�almost familiar to her now.� Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																					
3403	4	The concluding paragraph to the story �Winter Hibiscus� gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of event�s, her depression leaves her and she feels hope.�Then I will take that test again.� This final sentence shows Saeng�s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be the to lift your spirits. There is always a posative in negatave situation, you just have to look for it. 	2	2		2																					
3408	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. She decided to retake the test. Saeng realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on. Finally Saeng realized that good things can over come bad. After she failed the test she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summerizes the story perfectly.	2	2		2																					
3410	4	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3411	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was Not going to give up. Throughout the story she had been feeling down. From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. �She closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair....� This made her very imotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her.	1	1		1																					
3412	4	The author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up. Once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test.	1	2		2																					
3424	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																					
3434	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng did not give up on the test. for example, she says �I will take the test again.� It shows that she wants to take the test and pass it. Saeng is going to wait until spring comes and when the snow melts to take the test. In the beginning in the box above, it talks about her taking the test. Then it ends with her going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3436	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3438	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																					
3439	4	She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she is really striction  her.	0	0		0																					
3442	4	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing she will pass it. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
3443	4	Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, �when they come back�, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the �hibiscus is budding� then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready.	3	3		3																					
3444	4	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn�t a quiter. Saeng can�t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she�ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it.	1	1		1																					
3445	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the �Madagascar periwinkle� growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1		1																					
3447	4	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again	0	0		0																					
3450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says �And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, saeng broke down and wept.� This passage shows that she didn�t want to fail. When Saeng got home she had the white bud in the pot and her mother seen that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng to the shovel and did it he self. Having her realize she can take it again	1	1		1																					
3452	4	Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3455	4	The author concludes this story with the few words �then I will take that test again.� because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing �the test.�	1	1		1																					
3461	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																					
3462	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because its how each year will begin and end.	0	0		0																					
3467	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2		2																					
3475	4	the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like a interesiting ending paragraph that have something to do with the story	0	0		0																					
3477	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng decides to retake failed driver�s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I�ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng�s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.	1	1		1																					
3482	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, �I just stared at the hibiscus,� this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2		2																					
3484	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line �.. Slowly fading into the distance.� Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line �� Through the quiet repition of season upon season.�.

3498	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	2		2																					
3502	5	"The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a mixture of both happy and sad because of the way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now but he keeps those happy memories. Most of other ideas like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" makes me feel happy that his parents were so determind. Overall the main idea is remembering the good and bad times of his life and the mood for this idea is happy/sad."	2	3		3

3510	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend.

He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up.

Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals.

3682	5	"This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one."	2	2		2

For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.""     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies."	2	3		3																					
3689	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life.

3691	5	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements.

3705	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. Lastly @CAPS1 @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad."	2	2		2																					
3709	5	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.	2	2		2																					
3710	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3	3		3																					
3712	5	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. "	3	3		3																					
3715	5	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.	3	3		3																					
3726	5	Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends.	2	2		2																					
3733	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1																					
3741	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful because Narciso is glad to be in @LOCATION1 with his family. In paragraph @NUM1 lines @NUM2-. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more a courageous thing then I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. This is why the mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful."	1	2		2																					
3745	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the @CAPS1 is trying to re-create his/her past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."""	2	1		1																					
3749	5	"According to the memoroir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude."""	2	2		2																					
3756	5	This memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how @PERSON1 parents created a home. His parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. He is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to @LOCATION1 with little and creating a foundation for their future life. He's thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home. The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home. Durring this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to @LOCATION1, that is why this memior also has a happy mood.	2	2		2

3767	5	"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his ""parents not able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 Narciso talks about all the good things that happened. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described her Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2		2																					
3776	5	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.	2	3		3																					
3780	5	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."	3	3		3																					
3795	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author?The mood that the authors creates while writing this passage is very cultural like. Because she reason is. That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones. Thats what I showed you in these two paragraphs."	1	2		2

3805	5	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1).

The phrases he uses to help describe the house like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author.

The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two.

This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright.

The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life.

4120	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""	3	3		3																					
4121	5	I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them.	2	2		2

The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood."	3	2		3																					
4135	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family.

But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir.

I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""

Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3

In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."""	2	2		2																					
4261	5	"The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This also gives me the feeling of warmth and love."	2	2		2																					
4262	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting."	3	2		3

Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people. So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in.	3	2		3																					
4270	5	"The mood created by the author is that he is realy happy that his parents moved to america to live close to friends and family because in paragraph @NUM1 it says"" countless extended family members came and went -- and there was alway someone temporarily staying with us."""	1	1		1																					
4273	5	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4277	5	"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them."	2	3		3																					
4279	5	"The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends."	3	3		3																					
4280	5	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of People. It talks about how @PERSON1's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @LOCATION1 , were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods.	1	0		1																					
4286	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3		3

In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house."	3	3		3

In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family.

I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir.	2	3		3

4412	5	In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez, The mood the author created was loved, because he showed that his parents gave up  what they had from Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better for their children. For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1. And the author discribed how he grew up in a triditional Cuban home and how you could smell the aroma of food, and Passionate Cuban music filled the air.

Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

4429	5	The mood created by the author memoir was upset to have to leave cuba but happy to be somewhere better. To have to leave memeries and friends and family is upsetting. Also its better because now their lives will get better. Everything they had befor they will soon have here. The mood created was upset but happy and excited.	1	1		1																					
4436	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why.	2	1		2																					
4447	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. first of all I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""... and for wich I am eternally grateful."" also it said ""wich I adore to this Day."" How I know that those where a @CAPS2 moode because if I where to say that it be @CAPS2, also there was nothing saying that @CAPS1 disliked it. Second of all, @CAPS1 would all ways tell his Parents that ""I will always be grateful to my Parents fo thier love and sacrifice."" also told them ""I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance. There for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created."	3	2		3

4453	5	"The mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude. The author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him. For example, they came to the United States from Cuba, without a clue of its customs or language. The authors parent's left behind their careers, their families and friends, just that they can have a better life for their baby. The author's parents let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet. The authors gratitude is clearly shown in paragraph six when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" The author clearly states that he is grateful for all that his parents have given him. The author also says that he thinks that what his parents did for him was the ""most courageous thing [that he] could have ever done."""	3	2		3																					
4454	5	The mood in this memior was happyness. It was happyness because he talks about how much his parents care not only about their family but also friends.	1	1		1																					
4455	5	In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each @DATE1 down thecape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear.	2	2		2

When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says ""They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters."" @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time."	2	1		2																					
4482	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of are lives it gives you alot of different moods.

I got this feeling because his parents did hard jobs because they loved their kids. I know this from when it states ""They had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" @CAPS2 @NUM3. These are the moods the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives."	3	3		3																					
4486	5	The main mood that is potrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion matter where they were from. The single force of staying over brought people together. That is how Narciso grew up with and with that was lucky and grateful.	1	2		2

For example, the author is in a loving mood of the begging of the memior. In paragraph two, he says ""...a love of cooking that is still with me today.""

His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"". Through everything they had been through."	2	2		2																					
4503	5	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.	1	2		2																					
4506	5	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious.

In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start."	3	3		3																					
4529	5	The title of the story is Narciso Rodriguez. The authro is the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez The mood I think is this story the author gave was pretty good. The author knew when to be excited and knew when to not be excited and he did a good story. The author put in explition marks in when the author was happy or sad. So to me I think this was a good story and I like it. The mood went right with it.	1	1		1																					
4533	5	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one.	2	3		3																					
4537	5	The mood created by the author I think he was in a good mood because the story didn't talk about nothing bad it talk about happiness and how parent reas their @CAPS1 with no help of any one, and how their @CAPS1 felt when they were big they were happy and proud.	1	1		1																					
4543	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family. While reading this memoir, I have felt comforted, sympathetic, and a strong sense of family, as I'm sure the author had too."	3	3		3																					
4546	5	"The mood  created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful, and courage. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""  The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents  mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful.  Those are my three quotes and examples of the mood created by the auother in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4549	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very greatful and happy. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that his parents had good cooking skills and then notes that he is very greatful. So basically he is very greatful that he had or has a chance to life as @CAPS1 and have the opertunities that others don't have. And very, very happy that he did not just live in a house. his parents made it into a home with loving memories and his family moments.	1	2		2																					
4552	5	The author created a mood of happiness and love. When Narciso Rodriguez was thinking back to the past he loved his home and his parents for what they did for him. The way, he lived was the mood of his house. It was free and welcoming. Just as the way his parents were to other immigrants. Narciso Rodriguez's cubian home was one of the most important things he cared about and grateful for.	2	1		2																					
4555	5	In this @CAPS1 this is the mood I think the author is trying to create. Well I think its happy. I believe this because he doesn't use depressing words or ephrasses. Also, he had a great family. He had stateted that he enjoyed his lifestyle and his home!	1	1		1

He reailzes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2		2

I think this @CAPS1 his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness"	2	2		2																					
4617	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.	2	3		3

One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same.""

The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner.

He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents.

Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir."	3	3		3

It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again."	2	2		2

4984	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It seems that way. It looked like he was happy. Why wouldn't he be happy? That is the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	1		1																					
4985	5	"According to the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was happy with his life.One example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When @CAPS1's telling about the apartment @CAPS1 grow up in the mood is happy. Although it wasn't much his parents made him comfortable in it. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba. In paragraph two ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a Cuban home to him.Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family. In paragraph four ""Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us."" Even though the people aren't blood related to him @CAPS1's still happy with them. Finally, based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created a happy mood. This mood was created because Narciso is happy with the life @CAPS1 lives."	3	2		3																					
4992	5	"The author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable. Here are the ways he creates it. He describes the kitchen and how his family loves to cook and entertain. He says that his parents have welcomed refugees to stay at the house that sets a welcomeing mood and that the parents care for their friends and family. To his family the word ""family"" means anyone it's important to remember that because a family could be anyone. That's how the author sets the mood."	2	2		2																					
4997	5	The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story.	1	1		1																					
5007	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
5008	5	"In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 creats a mood, here is the mood created. The first mood is the one of her house. She describes friends and family with cuban music along with the food here is one example of the food and music ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" And those are some reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives."	2	2		2																					
5012	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude Narciso Rodriguez, the author is grateful for the way his cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to begin with @CAPS1 thing that the author is grateful for are the cuban traditions that his family passed on to him. One of the traditions would be there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. @CAPS1 thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life even though it meant leaving behind, family, friends, careers and the country they loved That was the mood created by the author in this memoir.	3	3		3																					
5015	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives"" it tells us about a kid from Cuba.This memoir has a positive mood. It says that they keep family or friends in their home untill they get back on their feet. It tells us about the neighborhood he live in. And how theres many different types of immigrants there and how they all get along. The kid's parents have friends and family over for dinner. The parents give up everything their jobs, friend, and families so that their kid could grow up in @LOCATION1. "	2	2		2																					
5024	5	"The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage"	1	2		2																					
5028	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, talks about the fashion designers life and the mood created by the author. After his parents imigrated from Cuba, Narciso was very greatful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (para. six). Narciso believes in his Cuban heritage a lot. when coming to @LOCATION1, his neighborhood was full of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. All of which he considered his family. He was grateful for the life, friends, and family support his family has given him. His parents had shown him with their lives, and these teachings has been the basis of his life. Narciso is greatful for coming to @LOCATION1 and bringing his old home in Cuba to his new home in @LOCATION1. "	1	3		2																					
5030	5	"The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2."	2	2		2																					
5031	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blueprints of our lives the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciction. In the memoir @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 thanks his parents so much for everything they've done for him. @CAPS1 also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 knows it wasn't easy but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible. @CAPS1 writes, ""what they did was much more courageous then I could hae ever done."" @CAPS1 knows his parents took chances and did whatever to keep him happy which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling."	3	3		3																					
5036	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and grateful because the author is grateful of his parents for having a roof over his head, cooking food for him, and for having such courageous parents. That's the mood of the author in the memoir.	2	1		2																					
5040	5	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1		2																					
5044	6	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.	2	2		2																					
5050	6	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3																					
5052	6	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned.	3	3		3																					
5056	6	In Marcia Amidon L�sted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire state building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigibles load had cost the company @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building.	1	1		1																					
5057	6	"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task"	2	3		3																					
5058	6	The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast, The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, wich is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason wich should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that hight made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind.	3	2		3																					
5061	6	"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle. Which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there.  Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area. As well as not being able to fit. Thus, there was some need of more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Which was the lack of a suitable area."	2	1		2																					
5065	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose."	3	3		3																					
5067	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.	2	3		3																					
5073	6	In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governer of New York, Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5077	6	Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock.	1	1		1																					
5078	6	Obstacles the bulders faced was if they put a Mooring @CAPS1 At the top of the building it will Add stress to the building and they would have to modify the building to support the mooring @CAPS1. Another @CAPS2 they @CAPS3 is safty Most @CAPS4 Are Filled with Hydrogen which Are Highly Flammable. If there was A Fire it could @CAPS5 @CAPS6 of people Due to the fact its A Densely Populated Area. Nature Itself Also seems to @CAPS7 A @CAPS2 the winds Above the building were very Violent. then theirs the law where Airships can @CAPS9 Low Above urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5082	6	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.	2	2		3																					
5088	6	"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5106	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt said ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail."" A somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium"" which is a much more unstable gas and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another obstacle the builders faced was ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it very difficult to ancor a dirigible down to the mast and as the excerpt said they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. Those are the problems faced by the builders of the empire state building."	3	3		3																					
5110	6	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. L�sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times."	3	3		3																					
5113	6	Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support The stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen.	3	3		3																					
5116	6	In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the empire state building, the workers would have to go through a series of tasks such as, strengthening the steel frame, and designing a sturdy mast. If the frame were not strong enough, then the building would simply colapse. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame. Also with high-speed winds the mast would have be incredibly sturdy, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea would was found not only unsafe but it illegal. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked, nor will one ever.	2	2		2																					
5120	6	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5123	6	"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this enginering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area.  In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all in the excerpt The Mooring Mast will learned that the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building."	3	3		3																					
5124	6	"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible becacse of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over new york and the people in new york."	2	2		2																					
5141	6	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles."	1	2		2																					
5147	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below."	2	2		2																					
5151	6	"In Marcia Amidon L�sted excerpt The Mooring Mast, is about the empire state that was built to being the tallest building. There are copious of ways of the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states,� ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This @CAPS1 proves how it's likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with Fire. Another @CAPS1 that portrays how builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there when it states,... ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the safty of the people walking on the @CAPS5 and what if they get hurt. finally another @CAPS1 that portrays the obtacles the builders faced when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This @CAPS1 proves if the dirigibles blow the empire it's not the only building in danger others around it too."	3	3		3																					
5164	6	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, engeneers fused several obstacle when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the @CAPS1 state Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, there @CAPS2 problem was ""the stress of the dirigiblel's load."" With all this weight being transmited to the buildings foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation This was verry expensive todo. Sixty thousand dollars wer nesciary.Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked The winds would toss it around. A solution was putting waights at the back of the landing fields, but the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrans on the street"" like explaine in paragraph @NUM1. "	3	2		3																					
5168	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamable. This would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. All and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people."	3	3		3																					
5170	6	The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with.	2	2		2																					
5173	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																					
5174	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @LOCATION1 @NUM1, it explains that attaching a durgible to the building would add stress to the building's frame. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most durgibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles to catch on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, An obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used.	3	3		3																					
5175	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure.	2	3		3																					
5180	6	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems."	2	2		2																					
5181	6	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to @CAPS1 the structure. They had sudently had found some problems with one being the top of the empire state building.      Workers had tryed to figure out hwo they were going to but a Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there but there were different problems.	1	1		1																					
5184	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One of the obstacle was that buildings foundation had to be modified. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."". Being so high the dock would be moved around because of the winds. Also the blimp itself could not even attached itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it. In the end the dock wasnt meant to happen it came with a lot of problem for the builders and even the artitechs."	2	3		3																					
5191	6	"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles."	3	3		3																					
5208	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes.	1	2		2																					
5211	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern"	3	3		3																					
5217	6	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L�sted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (L�sted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (L�sted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was it unsafe or impractical, it was illegal."	3	3		3																					
5220	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success."	3	3		3																					
5224	6	"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. Also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to vilent air currents. Another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. The problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Those are the obstacles the workers faced"	3	2		3																					
5232	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One example is, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely. Another obstacle was, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law. It would also be very dangerous."	4	2		3																					
5234	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there is many problems unsolved because of the height made. Which means its harder to do because of how high it is. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible."" They're pointing that out because if ever a chance of a mess up and it starts to come crashing down, its coming down on one of the most populated cities in america. These are some obstacles builders have to face."	3	1		2																					
5237	6	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one the Empire State building natural structure can't handle its weight. Therefor architects had to make a stainless steel tower. Even after this was made they realized how flamable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that the airwaves at the top of that building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen.	2	2		2																					
5243	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges.	3	3		3																					
5249	6	"There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous."	3	3		3																					
5251	6	There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building.	1	2		2																					
5257	6	allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would of been much worse.Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. aqlso it is weighed down by the lead by lead weights. If it is over pedestrians It is not safe.	3	3		3																					
5258	6	"In the expert the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The fabiric that they use for dirigibles is very lighter.

5262	6	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" It would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
5264	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, Empire State Building building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around-a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked but in the end it had too many problems and proved to be impractical.	3	2		3																					
5265	6	"In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way."	3	3		3																					
5267	6	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""

Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to over come for any project."	2	3		3																					
5268	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstical was that it lacked safty. Dirigibles are highly flammable machiens when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic..  Another obstical that the Mooring Mast faced was @CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with a electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of @ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles would ""swivel around & around the mask"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) this would cause tension to build on the buildings frame and lead to a very unsafe inviorment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safty reasons leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable."	3	3		3																					
5271	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws. ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural."	3	3		3																					
5272	6	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there was they had to build a higher taller building.

Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents.

In conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5290	6	"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph @NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end."	3	3		3

5296	6	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast"	3	3		3

5303	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.	2	3		3																					
5310	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirig ibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind  needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.	2	1		2

5312	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city @CAPS1 of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work.	3	3		3																					
5320	6	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building."	2	3		3																					
5329	6	the obstacles the builder of the empire state Building faced were... When the were planning to build a mask for the Dirigibles. When they first tried to build it they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mask. The Empire State building had to souport both the mask and the Dirigibles. Then at the end of the story the figured out there was no way to do it. That was one of the obsticals.	1	1		1																					
5336	6	the obstacles the builders of the empire state @CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in @LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.	1	1		1																					
5339	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibes to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York as said in @CAPS1 6. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says that a big problem they faced was they could just land right on the flat roof and some other problems they faced in this @CAPS1 was the cable at the top of the building added stress to the building eleven hundred feet below the building and some of this work cost over sixty Thousand dollars. Problems with safety is the lead wieght be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was niether practical or safe. And another unsafe thing is in @CAPS1 @NUM2, they said that Hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable which is very unsafe. In � @NUM3 it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas.	2	3		3																					
5340	6	"The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of the attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast it braught up many obstacles like the safety of the public. L�sted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if the dirigible were catch fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's problems.     These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. L�sted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move around the building while docked causing hazardous menuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk. For this mooring idea, it is too dangerous for the public and the city of New York."	3	3		3																					
5359	6	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish. First off trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame. They were able to fix that problem, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Overall the project was just doomed to fail from the start.	2	2		2																					
5361	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area.Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it."	2	2		2																					
5364	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast"	1	1		1

Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.	3	1		2																					
5373	6	"Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down. Lastly, It wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in The air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below."	3	3		3																					
5379	6	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.	3	3		3																					
5382	6	Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the ownes of the Empire state Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated area such as downtown New york.	2	1		2																					
5400	6	Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical. Those are obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5401	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"	3	3		3																					
5405	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians.  Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed.	3	3		3																					
5407	6	The mooring mast was a failure from the start.  The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most.  The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world.  Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp.	2	3		3																					
5409	6	"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger. The harsh wind nature would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings; also endangering the people below it."	3	3		3																					
5415	6	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. This made the builders have to modify the frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flamable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire state Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems."	2	2		2																					
5416	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work.	2	3		3																					
5425	6	"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building. First of all for it to be a @NUM1 ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they had to reinforce the base too to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire state building."	3	3		3																					
5431	6	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to fulfill many expectations and make sure everything was right, but while doing that they faced many obstacles. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle the builders faced was most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flameable. They realized how much worse it could be especially with a more populated area like downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With all of These obstacles the builders realized that this would not work.	3	2		3																					
5437	6	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building.  The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired."	1	2		2																					
5438	6	The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practicle. Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.	3	3		3																					
5441	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing."	3	3		3																					
5444	6	The wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it.	1	2		2																					
5445	6	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
5447	6	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were a lot. They had trouble with the area thing where they were going to do their job. ""The one obstacle in their expanded used in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obtacle that they had was with the mooring mast. ""the greatest obstacle to the successful of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. and if they did it it would become illegal to the ship that pass tie up to the building or even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
5448	6	the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reason that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. the greats reason was one of the safety: most dirigible from out sit the united @CAPS1 used hydrogen rather then helium, and and hydrogen is highly flammable.	1	1		1																					
5456	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM1) This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) All of these obstacles that the builders faced were very important and paved the way for the idea of dirigibles to be docked attop of the Empire State Building to be disarmed. The dangers involved were too significance and the top of the building now much safer purposes."	3	3		3																					
5462	6	There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast	2	1		2																					
5463	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. L�sted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5471	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted explains the Empire State buildings past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the buider Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced of the hardest one when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because of they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which haulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (L�sted @NUM1) This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in alot of breeze. Although there were many obstacles Al Smith worked his way around them and procceded to finish the Empire State building with corage to take on all obstacles."	1	2		2

5485	6	"Al Smith and the engineers faced many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obsticle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and killing millions. Another obsticle they faced was mother nature, In a height like 1,250 ft, theire are incredible winds blowing, and someone even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Findly, the law prohibites the dirigible to be ""flying too low over urban areas."" therefore doing this would be illegal. the building faced many obstacle, it got through most of them, but in the end it would be extremly unsafe to go on with mast."	3	3		3																					
5489	6	"On the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was very difficult, in my understanding it wasn't successful.Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the @PERSON1 air station, the navy leader offered it's dirigible to be used in testing the mast. And in figuring out if it's okay for the mast to be used architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast because it would cause stress to the building's frame. Also the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. It wasn't safe enough and because those dirigible that come from outside the @LOCATION2 don't always use helium they use hydrogen which is highly flammable which is a bad idea to have in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York."	3	3		3																					
5490	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, The builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. over sixty thousand dallors were spent on modifications for the building. after fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds the dirigibles were constantly shift. There wasn't a safe way to control shifting. Their was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. another reason was, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea.	3	3		3																					
5491	6	"The architects of late 1920s and 1930s New York had plans to revolutionize @CAPS1, and put New York at the forefront of modern travel. However there wild ideas fell short to reality. In an attempt to outstrip the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The place where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refule, had more hype than study. The biggest obstacle the builders faced was safety. Since most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were very flammable. If the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" had blown up above a more densely populated area than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As paragraph @NUM1 states, if the mast were a success, the weather would prove to be fatal. Even if the ship were tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around. The U.S. Navy tried to tie up next to the mast-before a law was passed not allowing aircraft the fly so low-but the wind may their efforts futile. The architects of the 1920s and 1930s were thinking big, but some obstacles were too big to leap."	3	3		3																					
5492	6	When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area.	3	3		3																					
5497	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there, they would just sit next to the point of the building. If Smith wasnt so competitive, the blimps would have a nice platform to dock on.	0	1		1																					
5501	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Is that when the Empire State Building was conceived, it was Planned as the world's. Then the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street. and @CAPS1 Avenue in new york. Before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip. this dirigibles or zeppelin and the @ORGANIZATION2 was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking.	0	1		1																					
5505	6	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add stressing to the building's frames. So they had to modify the building's frames to strengthen them. Also most dirigibles rather use hydrogen which is highly flammable and destroy a population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds constantly shifted and the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast making it unsafe for the pedestrians below. Finally another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5507	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacles was that the building with a mooring mast on the top of it attached by one cable to a dirigible ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle was to fix the buildings structure so it could with stand the mast."	2	1		2																					
5512	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, the author says ""The greatest reason was one of safety"". The dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flameable and they could not risk it in such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents"" This created another safety problem. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians. The author explained how ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" This being because it was just not practical nor safe."	3	3		3																					
5519	6	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment. Another obsticle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are some obsticales many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well."	3	3		3																					
5523	6	During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.	3	3		3																					
5526	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5527	6	When building the Empire State Building the @CAPS1 wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings that it would not be succeeded by the chrystler building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.	1	2		2																					
5529	6	While building the Empire state building people had to go through some obstacle to have it the way they want. They wanted Dirigibles to be able land/bord on the Empire state building. One of there obstacles was the use in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area. The other obstacle was a good one. The use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful.	1	1		1																					
5539	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea.	3	3		3																					
5541	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4		3																					
5542	6	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers.	2	2		2																					
5546	6	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.	3	3		3																					
5550	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3																					
5552	6	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Is because it would have added to much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomade this new situation"", as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they build the mooring mast on to it, now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. The builders faced these challenges in the attempt to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	2	1		2																					
5558	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5559	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.	1	1		1																					
5561	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. there were natural reasons and mechanical reasons. As well as time and safety. Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location of the building. When the to blimps attempted to go near to test it out One was too unstable to dock and the other through paper down a rope ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time and blimps wher flammable and dangerouse. Also, flying at that hight is illegal."	2	2		2																					
5563	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with.	3	3		3																					
5571	6	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp.Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas.""In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used."	2	3		3																					
5574	6	"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build 102 story building but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions it is not an easy task: In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock the top they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 constructing the mooring mast the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support itself. There were many obsticals that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project."	2	2		2																					
5576	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacle wer't successful using the mooring mast and the nature itself. But after the celebrating they were disappointed because the dirigibles wasn't able to dock there. After that another dirigible the @CAPS1 year blimp Columbia, attempted a Publicity stunt where it would fly up and deliver a bundle of news papers to the Empire State Building. when the stunt wan't success the blimp could be use for transportation in the Future.	1	1		1																					
5578	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5581	6	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.	3	2		3																					
5588	6	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most @CAPS2 dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few."	3	3		3																					
5590	6	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I would have been to large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York. Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock."	3	3		3																					
5592	6	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small framed building. Also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3. So those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the Empire State building in @LOCATION1	2	2		2																					
5597	6	"In the short story of ""The Mooring Mast."" by Marcia Amidon L�sted describes three obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced for the attemption to allow dirigibles to dock there. Two resons were safty. The first ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". A flammable ship above a ""densely populated area such as dowtown New York could result in desistiar. The second safty reson was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifing due to Violent air currents."" Dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither Practical nor safe."" The final obstacl the Empire State Building faced was Law. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" ""This Law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the buildings or even approach the area."" The Law and to safty obstacles the builders of the Empire' State Building faced would not allow any attempts for dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5599	6	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable land area. Another Obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. They also had to make shore that No sharp objects would punkener the dirigibles. These are the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire state building faced.	1	2		2																					
5603	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
5604	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building some obastacles they faced were challenging. One name they called the dirigibles in the @DATE1's was ""Transportation of the Future"". There was also an existing law against airships flying to low over open areas. The builders had to make lots of changes to make this perfect and get it the way they want it. Safty was the most important, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of using helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it. In addition ""The highest open observation deck, Intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"". And to this day is not open for the public to use."	2	2		2																					
5614	6	"The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles."	3	1		1																					
5615	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects went through many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.The engineers had to go through different expirences and consult with experts, and take tours of the equipment that would be used on the project. The architects had to realize they couldn't @CAPS1 drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, they had to realize the consequences and danger, like the wind pressure. Also, fires if a firework you happen many people would get hurt or killed due to New York's population The architects faced many obstacles but then taught them the danger and outcome if building the mooring Mast.	2	3		3																					
5617	6	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, tha't four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have no where to land this thing. They couldn't put it above new york because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.	2	3		3																					
5619	6	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles durring construction. While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties.	3	3		3																					
5627	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is one paragraph @NUM1 ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."	1	1		1																					
5632	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it."	3	3		3																					
5641	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Another obstacle was the buildings structure if the blimp had docked there would be stress on the building ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"""	3	3		3																					
5642	6	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
5643	6	Throughout the story workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacles they faced was trying to ge a thousend foot drigible mooring at the top of the building. This was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing so would be very difficult to land. The last obstacle was it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5645	6	"The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems."	3	3		3																					
5654	6	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe.	3	3		3																					
5656	6	Some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the Empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. This reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth. which mad it harder to keep in place.Another obstacle would be, @CAPS1 bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. It would pouncher the blimp. There was only made of cotton fabric.	1	1		1																					
5657	6	"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" @CAPS1 some of the obstacles the builders ran into"	2	3		3																					
5665	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
5668	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the constructors of the Empire State building faced many dificulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city."	3	2		3																					
5673	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when al Smith realized that he was close to Not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he annonced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he cant make the dirigible, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible."	0	0		0																					
5677	6	"The workers on the Empire @CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5680	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this task was not so easy. The builders of the Empire State Building could not just drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the size of the dirigibles were affected. ""The architects could not simile drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be difficult to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The cost to improve the building's framework was also an obstacle. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1)."	3	3		3																					
5683	6	They faced challanges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. There was really no safe way to do it. They also sayed the gas that keeps it floating is highly flamable. So it was like one big safty concern.In reality they ended up realizing its too dangerouse for them to do. If they took the chance and something went wrong innocent people could die.	2	1		2																					
5687	6	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flamable gas in the dirigibles, dangerous to be near a densely populated area, the wind were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles.         Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe.	3	3		3																					
5697	6	The builders of the empire state building faced alot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to let allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before @CAPS1 they didnt know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first Al smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things werent that easy. They faced complications with the @ORGANIZATION1 with there research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was @CAPS1 high up in the air, and there was alot of practicing involved. Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain.	3	3		3																					
5701	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Also ""Dirigibles were docked by which means of an winch, @CAPS1 thats what they did and faced to dock there."	1	0		1

The Way that this all @CAPS1 was when the archetect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, A building that was taller than the new chrysler building and one that was futureistic.

This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. the next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care, His building was the tallest."	0	1		1																					
5712	6	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun.	3	3		3																					
5713	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey.The architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building, if it did it would add stress to the building's frame. The Stress of the load and would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened.The greatest obstacle  was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would around and around the mooring mast. You could weigh it down but that would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, which was neither practical or safe.There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. And When they tried delivering newspapers they noticed it wasn't going to work	3	3		3																					
5714	6	The builders had to face alot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldent just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. A Dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add alot of stress to the buildings frame. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened. Also all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the buildings framework better.	2	1		2																					
5715	6	To have a building built Over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas. Those are many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.	3	3		3																					
5717	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would and stress to the building's frame."" This means that they would need to strength the whole building. If they didn't the building would maybe fall over. The next obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the wind is so strong up there, it would take a while to land safely. Also, that the wind could cause the dirigible to fly away. The @CAPS1 obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM3, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This means they could be a target to destroy the building. Another thing, is that if it ever fell it would kill a lot of people. These obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were not overcome and the project was cancelled."	3	3		3																					
5718	6	In the article 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 describes of several problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles dock there.For example, most blimps (dirigibles) out side of the United states used hydrogen, rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, and since downtown New York is so populated, if anything were to go wrong it could impact the people of New York, resulting in injuries as well as deaths.Another reason is an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. This law making it illegal for ship to even approach the area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could have been noticed before building.	3	3		3																					
5725	6	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon, it is filled with flamable gases, and to try to dock something that big on top of the worlds tallest building would be extremely dangerous too the urban town below and extremely dangerous for the workers.	1	1		1																					
5726	6	The builders of the empire state building @CAPS3 many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building. Also a big aspect of it was that they had to face was to be able to make it safe. These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe. The last problem they @CAPS3 was nature. Of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. So this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems.	2	2		2																					
5727	6	The problems That The empire state building faced was alot of things for one example it was Never @CAPS1 out clearly because They didn't know about The law That aircrafts could Not come @CAPS2 any suburb areas and They really saw what could of happened when The hindenburg burned to the ground. Anthor great obstacles They faced was Nature becuse The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents and This would cause The dirigble To swivel around the mooring mast. one last obstacle That was faced was The structure of the dirigble becuse if it kept on landing on Top of The building it would keep on destroying The building's sturcture. These are some of The obsacles that were faced.	3	2		3																					
5730	6	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and @CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The @CAPS1 to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. @ORGANIZATION2 wasnt in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing.	2	1		2																					
5734	6	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws."	2	2		2																					
5737	6	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe.	2	2		2																					
5742	6	The builders of the empire State Building faced many problems atempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were safety concerns. One issue was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flamable and explosive gas. A fire acident would be catastrophic, since down town newyork is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed. That meant no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast but they're biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, failure to address obvious problems.	4	3		3																					
5743	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.	2	3		3																					
5749	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safty factors and nature its self.Safty was a big obstacle in this plan for a morning mast because the dirigibles use hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building relized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to cech of fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners relized how much worse that accident could have been in New York.""The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and ontop of the building they were constantly changeing makeing it hard to dock. ""The winds ontop of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast couldn't be done."	3	3		3																					
5751	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.	2	3		3																					
5756	6	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as, safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.	3	3		3																					
5763	6	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea	3	3		3																					
5766	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature and the law. Safety issues was a problem because in the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This explains why they couldn't do it because of one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played it's role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5767	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved.	3	3		3																					
5768	6	The obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety. Safety was important because of how many people there are in New York. Another problem was the dirigibles outside the United States were hydrogen instead of helium. At such a high height the wind is very strong and the blimps are only being held by the front while the back would swing uncontrolably. A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
5771	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire state building was already huge & fragile so adding a lot of way to it, would not have helped, ""a @DATE1 foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects could not want this, they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1, it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"". After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful."	3	3		3																					
5775	6	"The idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast eleven-hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the theory is proven failure. ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to branish around the mast. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start."	3	3		3																					
5779	6	Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as to much wind movement, to much weight, and to many safty risks. when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.The wind movement would move the dirigibles around when trying to dock so they would have troubles with that. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building. They would have to pay alot of money to fix this problem.The last problem was a safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up they realized that it was way to dangerous to have blimps landing over crowded cities It was also a flying law of airships not being able to go that low over a city.This is why the builders had faced so many problems.	3	3		3																					
5784	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area."" (paragraph six) A second obstacle is the amount of stress a dirigible would put onto the building. As the author states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obsticle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located. Because of the location, the winds were so strong and the wind shifted constantly. The last obsticle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen thirtie's, the idea landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air transportation was given to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5787	6	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible @CAPS1 above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face will attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. For one thing the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart."	1	1		1																					
5789	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another @CAPS1 that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced."	2	2		2																					
5792	6	Many obstacles occured for the builers of the Empire State building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mass it would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State building was in New York, an urban area, the dirigable idea would have most likely never worked. The dirigable was unable to fulfill its destiny and the obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons.	3	3		3																					
5797	6	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station their for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to adding mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles were remodifing the building, so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (� @NUM1) A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being dock at the top of the Empire State Building, was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized that this danger, on May 6, 1937."	3	3		3																					
5803	6	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were @NUM1 main @NUM2.) After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New @NUM3.) When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far to windy for the light dirigibles to stay in @NUM4.) @CAPS1 with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. ""@CAPS2, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of @CAPS3 just to hold the back of the dirigibles down.@NUM1.) Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's.A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3																					
5810	6	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time."	3	3		3																					
5813	6	The builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not add an all steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would add too much stress to the frame and foundation of the building. If they were going to add a mooring mast, they needed to modify and strengthen the building's frame.The other problem the builders faced was safety. They had to consider the fact that may dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. The Building was in a densely populated area in downtown New York City. The last obstacle the builders faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were very strong and the air currents frequently shifted. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast.	3	3		3																					
5816	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea.Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stateing that airships couldn't fly to low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast.	2	3		3																					
5818	6	The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, especially in New York. The air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful.	2	2		2																					
5819	6	The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building aced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air.  The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles.  The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.  The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air.  This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off.  Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City.	3	3		3																					
5824	6	"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical."	2	2		2																					
5825	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3																					
5832	6	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. The builders first talked about such as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to @NUM1 feet. But now there obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the empire state building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the empire state building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work.	0	1		1																					
5836	6	"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and the dirigibles would be able to take the mooring mast up to the top of the building. The architects found out that if they put the mooring mast on the top of the building its gonna bring stress to the building's foundation."	1	1		1																					
5839	6	"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air current was a big risk.

This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten."	2	2		2																					
5843	6	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high speed winds and being able to get passengers off and on. They never did solve this problem, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was.	1	2		2																					
5845	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced a few obstacles during there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were the structure of the building. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would, ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The Steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new Situation."	2	2		2																					
5846	6	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State were changing a lot due to bad weather. The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down the other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down. Also because downtown New York is a very densely populated place. That is the obstacles the Empire State building faced in creating a docking area for blimps."	3	2		3																					
5853	6	The obsticals that the builders face in attempting to allow dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly that low to buildings. They also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the wind. They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They did not want what happen to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York. Dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe.	3	2		3																					
5857	6	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the Safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen which is more flammable then the helium ships.	2	3		3																					
5860	6	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
5865	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are in many ways. In my own opinion I think the Empire State Building is familiar to different people but not many knows the purpose to serve a landing spot for dirigibles. For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles.In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The quote that I have just stated means that it allows passengers to go places where they want to. In conclusion, those are two examples the describes the obstacles and that allow dirigibles to dock there."	1	1		1																					
5870	6	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen.	3	3		3																					
5873	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. Those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	3	3		3																					
5874	6	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" @CAPS1 starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it. All of these obstacles were faced by the builders of the mooring mast, which eventually led to the disregarding of the idea of using the mooring mast for ships."	3	3		3																					
5878	6	The Empire State Building was meant to be great The tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles.	3	2		2																					
5882	6	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building. ""The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."	3	3		3																					
5883	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock tere. Many foriegn dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it a float. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and has proven to be. on @DATE1 a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire caused from hydrogen, in New jersey. When the owners of the Empire State building the severity of this happening they were turned off.Nature if anything was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"". The law if anything was pretty important to get approved, and tere was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area."	3	3		3

5891	6	"Marcia @CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The Steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives @CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill it's purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York."	3	3		3																					
5892	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1 line @NUM2) because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter then air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass."	3	3		3																					
5895	6	"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the frame work of the building wouldn't collapse. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of egineers are here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs alot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the empire state building. The egineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These were a few of many obstacles the workers faced"	3	2		3																					
5897	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon.A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.	2	3		3																					
5906	6	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the worlds tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions. Unfortunatly they never found a way to successfully complete this task and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps. 	1	1		1																					
5908	6	When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose.	3	2		3																					
5910	6	The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not notice them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem untill after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg.	1	1		1																					
5911	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. one of the obstacles were the crowded @CAPS1 they had for the dirigible. crowded @CAPS1 can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put alot of tension on the building and something could go wrong.	2	4		2																					
5916	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.  Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face.	3	3		3																					
5919	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ware extrem to over come.one obstacles for the builders was trying to make it so the building its self could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the to the building with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes.Also it is to low for a dirigibles to be flying because of the other buildings. The most important is the gases inside the dirigible is flamible and would be devistation to the people below in New York City.	3	2		3																					
5921	6	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose."	2	3		2																					
5922	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the Dirigibles. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and weather could make a landing the dirigibles very dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3																					
5925	6	One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe.	3	3		3																					
5931	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building. The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. 	3	3		3																					
5937	6	There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success.	2	1		2																					
5938	6	On December 11, 1929 a man named Al Smith announced he was building the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet This building was the Empire state building in New York, that would be used for a dirigible mooring But, there would be a few obstacles to face, that would cause the dirigible mooring to not successfully be used.Al Smith announced he was building this mooring mast but did not announce potential obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway. Another issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the dirigibles.	2	2		2																					
5939	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes.	3	2		3																					
5941	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge acadent One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there"	4	3		3																					
5954	6	"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the @CAPS1 of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications.Several complicostions occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger."	2	3		3																					
5956	6	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there. Passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel.	2	2		2																					
5959	6	"the obstecles the builders faced was many of them. one of the things they faced was that they dident No if they wanted to build the tower in the first place.

And one of the greater obstacles was mooring mast was nature its self."	1	2		2																					
5961	6	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated."	3	3		3																					
5969	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen steel frame of the Empire State building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the @DATE1's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself. violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe.	2	3		3																					
5973	6	"In the exerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock. One example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe way to attach it. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to strength and modified the building because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundren feet below.""

5978	6	In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. The builders should have relized all the hazards. They were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the moorning mast for dirigibles and their passengers.	3	2		3																					
5981	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the reader learns about many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most important obstacle to overcome was safety. The United States used hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles. As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders faced was that there was a law, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles yet in the end, ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4)"	3	3		3																					
5983	6	"In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occured, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 eiven started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It would never make it from the start."	3	3		3																					
5989	6	"Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to. The builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law agianst airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles. The wind was also a problem as it could take the dirigibles a different dirrection."	3	2		3																					
5991	6	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an acident abuve New York City it would be bad because New York is so poluted.Another problem was"",they could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the empire State building's Flat roof."" This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. Al Smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller."	2	2		2																					
5994	6	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."	3	3		3																					
5999	6	The Problems @CAPS1 face with Building dirigibles to dock there was a lack of Suitable land area and the mooring mast could not Be Simply Drop on the empire state Building flat roof and on top of that A dirigible A thousand feet up held By a cable tether would add a lot of stress to the @CAPS2 frame the stress of the dirigible load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the @CAPS2 foundation. And the other Reason was a safety Reason most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen which is highly flammable.	2	3		3																					
6001	6	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used."	3	3		3																					
6004	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced alot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas. Those are some obstacles the builders faced.	3	2		3																					
6006	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. It also was'nt safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wont swivel around the mooring mast. Also sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frameworK. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city. It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast.	3	2		3																					
6008	6	Based on the excerpt to The Mooring Mast, the builders who constructed the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One of many obstacles was nature itself. The winds that are on top of the building were always shifting, because of the violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around & around the mooring mast, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammible. as you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building.	3	2		2																					
6010	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L�sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Most of the problems were avoidable, except for that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."""	3	3		3																					
6015	6	"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the atempt of Building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles. The first obstacle to building the Empire State building was that the engeier Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State building, ""the world's tallest building."" ""When the Empire State building was conceived, it was planed as the world's tallest building, taller even then the new Chrysler building that was being constructed."" (@CAPS1 1) the proble was that the architector of the Chrysler Building put a 185 ft spire inside the building. Al Smith got an idea that would make the Empire State Building taler and beater. His idea would be more than a ""ornament"" ""their top, the said, would selrve a higher calling. The Empire State building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" He believed that he could use the building as a dock for dirigible, so people could get on and off. The proble was that that the frame would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) They attempted to land dirigibles @NUM2 times but they weren't able to do it at the end. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3) They could not fix the problem."	0	1		1																					
6023	6	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed."	3	3		3																					
6025	6	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all it was a bad idea."	2	3		3																					
6042	6	Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of the non-U.S dirigibles docking. The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted they both experienced first hand the dangers of it.	3	3		3																					
6045	6	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.  Al Smith had a great idea but he did not realize all the problems.	2	2		2																					
6047	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be desasterous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous. the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a @CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles moored in open land feilds where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither @CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for.	3	3		3																					
6050	6	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people.	1	2		2																					
6062	6	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted on pages 1, @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3. She is basicly explainning the obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building and how it faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Examples are on page 1. ""They said that the empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank."	0	0		0																					
6066	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
6067	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented."	3	2		3																					
6071	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning."	2	2		2																					
6076	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
6080	6	There were a few obstacals to making this idea work. one of the obstacals was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind. There was over @MONEY1 spent on modification to the building. Also, they had to Add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors.	2	1		2

6091	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire @CAPS2 building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For @CAPS3, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transnitted all the way to the building's foundation. This shows that not only did they have to designed to take the load of the building but also the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether. The engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt In all the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to over come many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6092	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6097	6	During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information.	2	1		2																					
6100	6	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with	2	3		3																					
6103	6	The emire state building faced alot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. Which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. The building would now be 102 floors. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor.	0	0		0

The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."	2	2		2																					
6111	6	"Acording to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" and Then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. Another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, The set altitude was higher then the building was tall. The last obsticle was safety, in paragraph @NUM2 @CAPS1 talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. The mooring mast on the Empire State building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work."	3	3		3																					
6113	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers moring equipment had never been installed because, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off, or dying	1	2		2																					
6121	6	The Empire State building was built to compete with the Chrysler building and to compete they created a mooring mast. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles was: nature, the wind changes on top of the building were drastic, and some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another reason why was because it's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas. The examples above were all complications that restricted the derigibles to moor at the Empire State building.	2	2		2																					
6126	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast.

The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it. In @CAPS1 nine they say, ""The steel frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""

Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents.The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building.The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunetly, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong."	3	3		3																					
6134	6	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" @CAPS1 so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a drigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened."	2	1		2																					
6137	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was not easy. They had to draw out the plan for the mooring mast. The builders had to think about the thousand-foot dirigible that would be mooring at the top of the Empire State Building. They had to think about the wind pressure and of the load of the dirigible. The builders had to come up with brilliant ideas. The ideas were ""a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1) on top of the building. Builders had to build and think of the elevators and stairs to bring the passengers of the dirigible to the eighty-sixth floor. The eighty-sixth floor had baggage and tickets. They would come from the one hundred second floor. The builders had a hard job because they had to think of ideas on how to build the mooring mast of the building They also had to think about, how to bring the passengers in and out of the dirigible.

6140	6	"Due to Several factors the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework.""Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock. As well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law.

There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage.

6252	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph @NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework.Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration."	3	3		3

Along with the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction.If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the projectOverall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created.

6276	6	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not over come.	2	2		2																					
6279	6	The builders of the Empire States Building encoutered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg	2	2		2

6286	6	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared.	2	1		2																					
6293	6	The builders faced so many obstacles to dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacle's was nature itself, like winds on top of the building was shifting due to dangerious air currents. The back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The dirigibles would be dangling high above pedetrians on the streets, was neither practical nor safe. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There were so many obstacles to moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
6294	6	In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face.	3	3		3																					
6296	6	Dirigibles had a top speed of Eighty milles per hour, and they could Cruise at Seventy milles per hoor for thousands of milles witout needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet the same length as four bloks in New York City. The one obstacole to their expanded use in New York was the lak of a suitable landing area. The greatest obstacle to the sucsessful use of the mooring mast was nature it salf a window on the top were Constantly @CAPS1 due to biolent air corents.	2	2		2																					
6299	6	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.	3	3		3																					
6304	6	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains.	2	2		2																					
6306	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 t buiders of the Empire State Building faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another is ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

The architechs concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen, and modify it to make it work.Another obstacle. was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstace. Winds were constatly shifting due to violent air currents and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful."	3	3		3																					
6356	6	When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the begining. Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground. With those @CAPS1 being some of the most obvious problems some would think they wouldn't have attempted it but those obsticles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused.	3	2		3																					
6359	6	"While they were attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, then the dirigibles would be able to anchor there to refuel and let passengers off and on.Another obstacle that was faced was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which was extremely flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building felt that it wouldn't be safe if the dirigible set on fire with a densely populated area right below it.The greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The owners of the Empire State building believed that if something went wrong then the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. This was very unsafe."	2	3		3																					
6366	6	The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
6371	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet,"" @CAPS1 Dirigibles from outside the U.S. Were extremly Flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly Swivel around. USing led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. The last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. No Ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York."	3	3		3																					
6374	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by. Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Al Smith wanted to make the tallest building in New York. He had made the building very tall, 1,046 feet tall to be exact, but then, the Empire State Building was made taller, 1,250 feet. It was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in New York. A mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height. Although, the builders did not account the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,""... The mast could have caused huge chaos to New York if it did damage upon a dirigible passing in the air."	2	1		2																					
6379	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (L�sted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (L�sted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building."	3	3		3																					
6384	6	The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below. And since they had to do that The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation	2	1		2																					
6388	6	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast was the winds and the gases used in non-@CAPS1 dirigibles. The wind was a problem because that high up the dirigibles' back would swivle around the mooring mast. The gases used was a problem because out of country zeppelins used hydrogen which was highly flammable which would be bad if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated New York.	2	2		2																					
6396	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with  obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off. One challenged they encountered was the safety of everyone. In the excerpt they talk about how, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). The risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high. If it did catch on fire not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of New York. Another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. No one could predict the weather, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it. The winds could make the aircraft fly into buildings, which could damage the design of the dirigible. All in all, the challenges the designers had to build such a great building, were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed."	3	3		3																					
6402	6	The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. At the same time I would have been happy to be apart of something like that. The builders could have died doing there job. Building it so high up, it must have been hot. I dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. Those are some of the obstacles I think the builders went through.	0	0		0																					
6404	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2																					
6405	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe.	3	3		3																					
6408	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome."	3	3		3																					
6409	6	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields.	3	3		3																					
6410	6	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.	1	1		1																					
6416	6	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there Were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a bulding, feuling and Service, how to get passengers on and off as safe as possible, they also Should have thought about @CAPS1 a thousand foot dirigible @CAPS2 from the top of the building might do to its structure.The architects and engineers of the empire State building consulted with expert, letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. (Which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform.In all, over sixty thousand dollers worth of modifications had to be made to the builings foundation. And some dirigibles couldnt even dock	1	1		1																					
6419	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt. If something happened to fall, someone could get hurt. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That's the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	1	1		1																					
6433	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles @CAPS2 using highly Flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal.	3	3		3																					
6435	6	In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building.	2	2		2																					
6440	6	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced."	3	3		3																					
6441	6	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock."	3	3		3																					
6443	6	"Based on the excerpt, the morning mast there were @CAPS1 obstacals builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 on the empile state Building. Building a @NUM1 ft tall building was hard adding a Mast Would be even harder. Allowing a dirigible land and on the empire State building would be dangerous. The german dirigible the @CAPS3 Was destroyed causeing @CAPS4 of damage. ""The owners of the empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been If It had taken Place above a densely Populated area Such as down town"". There fore The mast was Put up but never was used as a dirigible @CAPS2."	2	1		2																					
6444	6	"In the excerpt  ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2		3																					
6446	6	Technology was not caught up to the dirigibles. they could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the righ equipment and that was one of the obstacle that the builders of the Empire State building faced. For @CAPS1: when they have to delivery the newspaper.	0	0		0																					
6449	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."	1	1		1																					
6453	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
6468	6	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York.	2	2		2																					
6471	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below."	3	3		3																					
6472	6	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not away for the dirigibels landing to be convinient for all. The dirigibels have a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibels were very big, and the building it self as well. The siz was a problem because the enormouse dirigibels woud not be landing in the right space. Having lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the making of the buiding to meet with thouse people took away time. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem."	2	0		0
