I think the author concludesdfs the storysdf with the paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to sdfovercome obstacles inher way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try asdfgain next spsdfing  to show diction and to sadshow her sdsgoal osdar decision in a different way for example, It says �, Almost relucantly, she realize that many ofthe things that sh had thought of as strange before had become,through the quietsdf repetition of season upon season aldsmost famfsdiliar now.� At first, geese flyinsdfg in the ky was new to her, ut now she�s use toit. Maybe the author is making a reference to the gedese since it will be familiar (the drivng test)and she will fsdpass like she got use to and familiar with eese. Since her fes. ut, Saeng seemed deterined to survive and oasdvercome it. The paragraph issfdf saying simplytht she�ll take the test again nextspring, but the author put that paragraph there to shw diction by emphasizing the geese epresenting learning somethinsg new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtonesthe point in the story, which is tdsfo not give up and the will to survive.
