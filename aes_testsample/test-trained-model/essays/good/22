I think the author paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles  in a different way for example, It says �, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of had become,season almost familiar now.� At first, geese  the sky was new to her, but now  and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she�s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she�ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive. concludes the story with the be familiar (the driving test) through the quiet a reference   repetition of season upon  goal or decision as strange before flying in in her way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try again next spring � to show diction and to show her she�s use to it.  is making to the geese since it will  and she will pass like she got use to Maybe the author.
