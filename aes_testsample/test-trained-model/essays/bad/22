	The Sunshine Physical Education  program, started by the Ministry of Education, requires students to do sports at least one hour a day. Due to heavy homework, most students, especially we middle school students, hardly have time to do physical exercise. What s more, PE classes are often cancelled. As a result, many of us are near-sighted and our health is continuously declining. Physical exercise will not only relax us but also help build our body. Besides, it will give us a chance to co-operate with others, thus forming a good habit of getting along with others. In my opinion, body building is important and necessary for us. However busy, we should spare some time to take exercise every day. Only in this way can we be equal to our future jobs.
