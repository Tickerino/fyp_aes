	Ads are around us every day and everywhere with its apparent advantage and disadvantage. We are involved into it, experiencing its good and bad. People who are for it believe that ads provide the information about latest products so as to increase sales and decrease the cost of goods. It helps customers to choose among all the available products by explaining features, functions or service. Good ads still can please customers visually and physically even can make the public aware of social problems. Those who are against it accuse some companies of using ads to mislead us by giving false information. Such bad ads, tiring our thoughts and eyeballs, take customers too much time or space on TV or newspapers with the only purpose to cheat money. It s immoral! Ads are like a 2-side sword. Anyway, we can be smart buyer if we can distinguish between fiction and fact.
