Some people take it for granted that some lucky numbers can bring them good luck. For instance, the so-called lucky number 8 is widely used now because it is sounded like getting rich in Chinese and is believed to bring good fortune. Yet many others dont think so. They think that numbers have nothing to do with luck. They regard numbers simply as mathematic symbols for counting. They are anything but a mystery. They laugh at those who think numbers can bring good luck. Im in favour of the latter opinion. I think our society is very modern now. We mustnt count on the so-called lucky numbers to fulfil our wishes. Whether we can have good luck depends on ourselves. If we work hard, good luck will come to us.
