Many students tend to cheat in the exams. Some will copy the answers from their books. Some will talk with each other to share the right answers. Besides, some even write down the information on their skin. There are several causes leading to cheating. Some students want to get high scores without efforts. Secondly, some are under great pressure and they fear to fail the exams. Once the students are found cheating, the teachers should punish them severely and explain the harm of cheating to them. There are at least two ways to eliminate cheating. On the one hand, we should explain the harm of cheating to our students. On the other hand, strict measures should be taken against cheating. As a result, the fair play in the exams can be achieved and students can pay attention to study instead of cheating.
