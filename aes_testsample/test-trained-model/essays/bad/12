Nowadays, motorcycles are popular around us. They have become an important means of transport in Chinese cities. Compared with the bike and the car, the motorcycle has its own advantages. First, it is quite flexible. When there is a traffic jam, it can go through the cars that are held up in the street. Besides, it doesnt consume much petrol. Most important of all, it can carry another person at the back. But every coin has two sides. The negative aspects are also apparent. To begin with, its very complicated to get qualified for riding a motorcycle. Youll have to go through a series of procedures to get a riding license. Furthermore, the maintenance is expensive. Worst of all, it costs a big sum of money to pay for the license plate, especially in Shanghai. In conclusion, it has both favourable and unfavourable aspects. However, if the authorities concerned simplify the procedures and reduce the cost of the license plate, the motorcycle will be accepted by more people.
