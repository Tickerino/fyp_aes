	Dear Tom<br><br>Greetings! I canâ€™t believe it is already Friday! The past week has been a flurry of activities and i am glad that I finally have the chance to relax before the start of another hectic week. Let me tell you the things i have done and my weekend plans.<br><br>On Monday, I was given Mathematics Exercise 3 to complete. Although it was due on Wednesday, I decided to complete the homework on the day itself. This proved to be a wise decision challenging Science assignment on Tuesday that was also due on Wednesday. As I lacked knowledge on the topic of flowering plants, I spent many hours researching on the Internet.<br><br>On Wednesday, I had to complete a Mother Tongue workbook exercise due on Thursday. On Thursday, I was given an exercise on Completion of Sentences which i had to submit on Friday.<br><br>This morning, I found myself in a dilemma. I had to choose between attending the class outing or the extra basketball practice as their timings clashed. I was tempted to participate in the class outing from 2-5.30 p.m., which was a movie screening. It would have been a great opportunity to bond with my classmates. However, basketball finals will take place next week and the extra practice will definitely boost our chances at winning the championship. In the end, I decided to attend the extra practice from 3 to 5 p.m. as I felt that it was of great importance in this final lap of the competition.<br><br>However, the activity that i am most looking forward to is meeting you on Sunday! It has been a long time since we spent the entire day together and I am open to any suggestions as to where we can play. See you on Sunday!<br><br>Your best friend<br>Jack
