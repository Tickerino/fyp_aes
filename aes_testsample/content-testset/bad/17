Furthermore, with the rapid growth of the world s population, the rising demand for water by industry, and the serious pollution of our surroundings, the world is facing the danger of running out of fresh water. Actually, in some big cities, fresh water cannot meet the daily needs.Therefore, to find new ways to save water is an urgent task. First, we should pass strict laws to control any waste of water.
