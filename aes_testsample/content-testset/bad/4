Nowadays there are a lot of false advertisements in society. They have caused much harm to society. Generally, their harms can be listed as follows. First, they exaggerate the functions of the goods they advertise and mislead consumers. Second, some advertisements contain obscene contents and bring about spiritual pollution. Third, they seriously damage the credit of businesses because the shops which sell those goods will be distrusted and even considered the conspirators of those advertisers by consumers. Personally, I am usually vigilant against any advertisements and so I have never been taken in. However, some people are credulous and are easily taken in. Therefore, in my opinion, effective measures must be taken to ban false advertisements and protect consumers interests. First, all the advertisements must be strictly censored by the authorities concerned before they are published. Besides, severe punishment must be inflicted on those who publish illegal advertisements. In conclusion, false advertisements must be eliminated in our society.
