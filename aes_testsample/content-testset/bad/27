On the very first day in college, I was surprised to find the campus was so large. Believe it or not, I even lost my way to the dormitory when I returned from the dining hall. At first, I had difficulty adapting myself to college life. In college, we had more free time than in middle school. In the evening, we were not required to study in the classroom. Instead, we could go anywhere and do what we want. I was at a loss on how to make use of so much free time. Then I borrowed a number of books from the library and most of them were novels, which I had no chance to read in middle school. Besides reading books in my spare time, I played table tennis for fun and made enormous progress. In my opinion, study should be the priority of our college life. Besides, we can take part in sports activities and have fun. Of course, we may take part time jobs to improve our skills. In all, college life should be colourful and meaningful.
