The News Report has always been my favourite TV program. Almost everyday I turn on the TV at 6:30 p.m. and wait for the news program. This has become a part of my life. The News Report contains a large amount of information â€“ from the international political situation to the latest foot-ball game. And the most important character is its fast pace. Because of this fast pace, news programs can contain much information in a short time. In my opinion, the News Report is more than a TV program. It is a way of communication. From this program, people can know and understand world affairs. The world thus becomes smaller and smaller. I especially appreciate this benefit of watching the news.
