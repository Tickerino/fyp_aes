Sports benefit us in many respects. When taking part in sports, we get the chance to train almost all parts of our body. There is no doubt that properly balanced physical activities keep us physically fit. Furthermore, sports can enrich our life and maintain our psychological health. Through participation, everyone can learn that on the playing field he not only competes for himself but also for his team. Sports teach us about consideration, cooperation and optimism, and how to cope with difficulties. But sports can do harm to those people who cannot balance their activities properly. Training too hard may hurt their body, exhaust their energy and even make them disabled. Personally, I love sports. I enjoy participating in sports. I feel that I not only gain a well-balanced life through sports, but also get more chances to move closer to nature. Sports have really added happiness to my daily life.
