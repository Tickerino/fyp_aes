The highest rate in August was due to unfavourable weather conditions. Humidity and high temperature make drivers impatient, which easily leads to car accidents. The high rate in the first half of 1990 was also caused by the bad weather condition. In Walton City the excessive rain comes at early spring. The rain made road slippery, which often resulted in car accidents. This year the pattern is expected to change. The city government has raised fund to improve the road condition. Two new roadsÂ will be finished at the beginning of this year and are expected to open to traffic soon. Furthermore, the new road regulation provides that in summer every car must be air-conditioned. With all these precautions, Im sure that the rate of car accidents will be much lower this year.
