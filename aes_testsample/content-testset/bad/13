Different people have different views on opportunity. It is held that there are few opportunities. But it is also held that there re opportunities everywhere. Those who hold the first opinion think that there are too many people and so there is always an intense competition for limited opportunities. In contrast, those who hold the second view think that if one is not prepared, he can hardly have any opportunities; however, if one is prepared, he can have a lot of opportunities. As for me, I agree with the latter opinion. Admittedly, there is really an intense competition for limited opportunities, but this is not to say that one cant create opportunities himself. In most cases opportunities are created by people themselves. For example, many people lost their jobs in recent years. Some people wait for opportunities in vain. However, others create opportunities themselves and get self-employed. Eventually they become employers themselves.
