It was last Saturday morning. I was walking toward the small bookstore near our school when I heard screaming. I quickened my steps toward the source of the screams and saw the gas station just opposite the bookstore was on fire.The front of the gas station and a car in front of it were on fire. People were shouting and running about and water was poured out from pipes. The car on fire was soon put out, badly damaged. But it was very difficult to put out the big fire on the gas station. Just at the urgent moment, there came the screams of fire trucks. With the help of the fire fighters, the whole situation was quickly under control. I do not know the exact reason why the gas station caught fire. But I think everyone should be careful at a gas station, because even a smoking cigarette can easily set fire on it.
